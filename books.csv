pressing Beauty to her ample breasts, Beauty's hip against the
Queen's smooth stomach. Beauty felt tiny as well as helpless, as if
she were nothing in this woman's arms, nothing but something
small, a child perhaps, no, not even a child. The Queen's voice grew caressing. ""You are sweet, sweet as Lady Juliana told me you were,"" she

she needs to support herself with the words that leave her mouth without

recently have they started greeting her and not her assistant who’s a man,

sticky trail, slithering until they pile up, one on top of the other, and rot,
vitiating the air with their rancid smell. He doesn’t answer because he
also knows that she has few female employees working for her. And if
one of them were to get pregnant, she’d look down on her, disregard her. She shows him a cage and tells him that the specimen is a heroin

a few screws loose up there. The power of sex is marvelous, I realize, thinking of the

three helpings into himself, and the mummy seemed more distant and
dreamlike with each helping. It was not real, those things were never real,
they came fully to life only between the commercials of the late-night TV

get two monsters for a quarter—and if you had an extra quarter, you could

he adored her. They spent Christmas in St. Moritz, and at Easter he wanted to take her to
Hawaii, but took her to Palm Beach instead because it was closer, and she was
almost seven months pregnant. She had an easy pregnancy, and everything had gone smoothly. The doctor was
only mildly concerned about what would happen to her pelvis when she

dignity about her. There was an unmistakable quality about her, as though she
had suffered and come far, paid a high price for her freedom, and felt it was
worth it. It wasn't anger one sensed about her, it was a long-suffering kind of
patience. She had seen too much in her short years, life and death, and betrayal, and it
showed in her eyes. Molly York saw it the moment she looked at Grace, and she
was touched by the raw pain she saw there. ""I'm Molly York,"" she explained quietly. ""I'm a psychiatrist. Do you know

The day did not begin as I had imagined. I did not lie under my

if he called Frode to ask for a lift to the station, the car would somehow refuse to start in the cold. The old man must have thought long and hard how he was going to hook him. Blomkvist had the feeling that every
last thing that had happened since he arrived was staged: the introductory surprise that as a child he had met his host,
the picture of his parents in the album, and the emphasis on the fact that his father and Vanger had been friends,
along with the flattery that the old man knew who Mikael Blomkvist was and that he had been following his career for
years from a distance. . . . No doubt it had a core of truth, but it was also pretty elementary psychology. Vanger was a

Morgan
throws the wine glass into the Thames where it’ll sink to the bottom to
join other objects like leather shoes and goblets preserved deep in the river
bed from before the Roman invasion
as Londoners are proud to brag in those documentaries fronted by posh
gits who’ve been to public school
they take a last drag of their third roll-up, stub it out, will slope off to
the expensive hotel room in King’s Cross in order to get the first train out of
The Smoke in the morning, when they see someone familiar standing
talking to a black bloke they recognize off the telly, Roland somebody, all
poncey in a bright blue suit
it’s the kid from their lecture last year, what’s her name? Morgan recognizes her from their first ever talk on being trans delivered
at an International Women’s Day event at a university in Norfolk last year
she’d been unmissable sitting in the front row of the lecture theatre with
a crazy-ass afro and stunning face, clad in a tee-shirt with a blonde Barbie
image on it, the words IRONY scrawled in black underneath
very witty, kid, Morgan thought, you’re my kinda person
Morgan only agreed to do that first university talk because it
supplemented their paltry salary serving in Drunken Nostalgia down the
road from the cottage, the hangout for the local dropouts who don’t mind
their glasses stained with lipstick, crockery chipped, tables left unwiped and
toilets turning into rivers of urine through which they not so much walk as
wade
Aaron, the owner, likes Morgan because they’re a mardy cow and as a
non-binary bald person with tattoos is cooler and edgier than most
all meant as a compliment, and taken as such
Aaron says he’ll says lose his core clientele if his staff look normal and
are nice to people, or if he smartens the place up, his happiest times were in
the Student Union bar in Manchester just before closing time on a Saturday
night
been trying to re-create the same vibe ever since

being trans is personal, Morgan began, trying to sound confident in the
windowless lecture theatre, their first time actually inside a university let
alone delivering a talk, and I interpret trans to include non-binaries like me,
trans men, trans women and cross-dressers, others might interpret it
differently
talk about scary, standing rooted in the spotlight, confronted by rows of
unsmiling students, all of them more educated than the person they’ve come
to hear
Yazz, that’s her name, was different, grinning with pre-approval
it felt like the rest were staring down at a circus freak
as if they weren’t alien youngsters from the world of normal by the look
of what was obviously the fashion there for girlie dresses
although Morgan suspected a few might progress to khakis, combat
boots and tattoos to rival theirs by the time they graduated
I can only represent myself, Morgan said, warming up by forewarning
the audience against their doubtless assumptions that all trans people are the
same, I’m not a spokesperson for everyone or the leader of a transgender
movement, merely an explainer of my own unique journey into being nonbinary, more specifically, I consider myself to be in the gender-free category
Morgan made eye contact with the fresh-faced youngsters who made
them feel, at twenty-seven, incredibly worldly-wise
gender-free means I identify as neither male nor female, I also identify
as pansexual, which means I’m attracted to individuals on the male-femaletrans spectrum, although my long-term partner is a trans-female and I’m not
trading her in any time soon, not that it’s any of your business who I sleep
with, if you really must know, I’m spoilt for choice, all bases are covered,
yeh, I’ve got it made, peeps! laughter erupted around the room, whew, ice broken, Morgan had
managed to entertain a room full of people – a first
Sandy the lecturer, sitting in the front row, long hair dyed blue, wearing
a medieval-style dress, who’d come across Morgan on Twitter, beamed
appreciatively that her untested guest speaker was delivering on the goods
to her charges
Morgan talked for nearly an hour about their experiences of growing up
their rejection of feminine ideals (while simultaneously being ignorant
about feminism), their nervous breakdown (the lost months at the
Quayside), leaving home (for a hostel), finding a partner who was right for

them, not mentioning Bibi by name (keep me out of it, love, I’m oldfashioned, I only want a private relationship with you, I don’t want to be
part of your public brand)
Morgan discovered it was actually enjoyable talking to the students,
who were quickly and obviously rapt, especially when it came to their
decision to get a pair of unwanted breasts surgically removed
Morgan hadn’t planned this, it just seemed fair and honest to do so,
knowing they’d be curious
they told them it was a relief to have their breasts departed forever, and
as they’d been bound with a compression shirt for so long, nobody much
noticed, their lover was fine with it, said they’d fallen in love with Morgan,
not their body parts
Morgan said their body felt lighter after the soreness had subsided, the
pleasure they get from being able to sleep comfortably face down
to never again see them bobbing up in the bath like two unsinkable
buoys
they were going to get tropical bird tattoos inscribed on that part of their
body in time, turn their chest into a spectacular work of art
when they’d finished, hands shot up for questions, Morgan was praised
for being so brave, fascinating, educational, entertaining
Morgan felt that all the years of exploring gender in books and in
discussion with Bibi had paid off, and has done a few more gigs since
so this Yazz came rushing up at the end of the class to exclaim that the
lecture (lecture?) was mind-blowing, and she was thinking of becoming
non-binary as well, how woke was that? she said excitedly, like she was
going to embark on a trendy new haircut
Morgan let the kid down gently
she needed to know that being trans wasn’t about playacting an identity
on a whim, it’s about becoming your true self in spite of society’s pressures
to be otherwise, most people on the trans spectrum felt different from
childhood, they said, trying not to sound too harsh as the audience filed
slowly out of the room, a few students hovered around to listen in, all
friends of this Yazz it transpired, including a Somali-looking girl wearing a
blinged-up hijab, a rosy-cheeked milkmaid who looked about twelve, and a
Kardashian-Arab type with a designer handbag, cleavage, heels, and black
hair so straight and glossy it looked like a wig made of plastic (weren’t
students supposed to be scruffy and smelly?)

it’s something inside you, Morgan said to her, not a trend, although
others might adopt a trans position as a political statement, which is okay
when it comes from a place of integrity, of solidarity, when it’s a genuine
rejection of society’s gender impositions
not because it’s hip or woke
it’s why women became political lesbians years ago, choosing to have
sexual relationships with women because they’d had enough of sexist men
not because they no longer desired them
Morgan had come across this in the online archive of a long defunct,
second-wave feminist magazine called Spare Rib
if they’d been too harsh on Yazz, it didn’t show, she was nonplussed,
insisted on dragging Morgan off to a campus café with her entourage
where they unashamedly pumped their visitor full of questions and
cappuccinos and were so irreverent about transgender issues, Morgan
loosened up
which didn’t happen very often (according to Bibi)
Waris, who was Somali, joked it was easy in some Muslim societies for
a man to pass as female because you just went out in purdah and nobody
was any the wiser
Courtney, the milkmaid, said she’d like to transition to male because her
father would have to leave the farm, if the bank didn’t claim it, to her
instead of her younger brother, it was the only reason she knew what the
word primogeniture meant
Nenet, the Kardashian, said she couldn’t become a man because she
liked wearing high heels too much, barely finishing her sentence before the
others pounced on her for getting it all wrong
as if they were suddenly the experts
and here was Yazz popping up again, at the National, rescuing Morgan
from feeling isolated
it turned out that she was the daughter of Amma Bonsu, and like their
first encounter Yazz was so excitable, it was infectious

my gaesh made easy and effective talismans, sharpening my tenyé with
protections from magic and fire—the latter a special spell Tyentso and I had

in town, Nzinga sank into a terrible funk for days
it was a sign Dominique was rejecting her
who never mentioned it again. 5
Before arriving at Spirit Moon, Dominique had naïvely thought of
housebuilding in purely romantic terms; she’d imagined her lean, long,
much admired body becoming even more toned, supple and strong through
using it as nature intended – working in the great outdoors, doing strenuous
physical exercise, enjoying camaraderie with her co-workers, getting
sweaty and dusty and looking forward to showering it off at the end of the
day before sitting down to a hearty meal
work would be simple, vigorous and life-enhancing
well, it didn’t quite work out like that
having never lifted anything heavier than stage weights, she found
eight-hour days of manual labour unbelievably gruelling, her joints ached
and never had time to recover, her smooth, elegant hands blistered,
lacerated and coarsened, even underneath protective gloves, and she had to
wear a helmet that didn’t shield her face from the sun
she imagined herself down the line: practically crippled, calloused, with
a face as craggy as an ancient fisherman
Dominique decided she wasn’t cut out for such work, unlike her coworkers who were built like brick-houses, including Nzinga
they were the butch ones, she was not, and even if she was (she’d never
felt the need to categorize herself) it was clear American butches totally

outclassed British butches in the Butch Universe
Dominique felt quite femme beside them
at the start of her second week on the job, she refused to get out of bed
because her back felt like it was broken, yes, broken, she told Nzinga,
looking tragic, doleful, tearful, until Nzinga promised her lighter duties cos
I gotta look after my baby, don’t I? thereafter Dominique’s duties involved minor jobs such as hammering
nails, stapling insulation to timber frames, painting, decorating, and
providing coffee and snacks several times a day
at home, Nzinga insisted on cleaning the log cabin herself, because she
wanted to make sure it was as dust-mite free as possible
Dominique didn’t object, seeing as her idea of housework had always
involved waving a feather duster-wand over various surfaces as she skipped
around a room
Nzinga also insisted on doing all the cooking because she alone
understood how to formulate the right nutritional balance for them to
sustain perfect health, which Dominique wouldn’t have minded except
Nzinga cooked without salt, which was banned from the house, and spices,
which Nzinga said agitated both the stomach and the emotions
eating became both an unpleasant ordeal and a performance of
enjoyment
Nzinga also washed Dominique’s clothes, by hand, because I am
enslaved by my love for you, she said, in jest or perhaps not, in spite of
Dominique’s protestations that she wanted to wash her own undies,
especially the ones stained with menstrual blood
Dominique began to regret allowing Nzinga to do everything and make
decisions for her
she started to yearn to do the housework herself, yearn to cook, to clean,
to do a job that was more intellectually demanding
her life was becoming empty of purpose other than to love Nzinga
unconditionally, and, increasingly, obey her
even the simplest things became a source of difficulty
was it really her fault men ogled her in town when she wore (kneelength) shorts and a (sleeveless) baggy tee-shirt
should she really have to cover up instead of being ‘provocatively
dressed’ as Nzinga accused her

why should she wear her hair (usually a thick, wavy mixture of Afro
and Indo) almost shaved to her scalp, cut by Nzinga herself with the
barber’s clippers she bought for this very purpose? why shouldn’t she have a chat with the gentle community baker, Tilley,
when she went to collect bread in the mornings? because the women who appear the nicest are the most passive
aggressive and ultimately the most dangerous because they will come
between us, don’t you realize that people want to sabotage our great love
affair? and why shouldn’t she read books by men that she’d picked up in the
library in town? you can’t live a womanist life and have male voices in your head,
Sojourner
that doesn’t make sense, it’s taking things too far
why don’t you shut your goddam mouth
they were sitting up in bed, it was the early hours, again, Nzinga had
been on her case about her past girlfriends for hours, she brought them up
every so often, this time trying to convince Dominique they had been
playthings who meant absolutely nothing to her
Dominique was fed up of convincing her that past girlfriends weren’t a
threat to their present relationship, she’d already told her many times that
the love she felt for a couple of them was nothing compared to what she felt
for Nzinga, not realizing that to admit any kind of love for her exes was
unacceptable
she wanted to leave the room, to sleep elsewhere in the cabin, or on the
porch, anything to escape Nzinga’s droning voice; not possible, Nzinga
would follow her out of the room and keep it up, sometimes until dawn
they were all white women, they were never going to stick around
I’m the one who left them, it was true, she was the dumper, never the
dumpee
what I’m saying is, only a black woman can ever truly love a black
woman

I don’t want you to give in, I want you to change, to understand my
reasoning at a deeper level and accept it as the truth. 6
Almost a year to the day Dominique had arrived at Spirit Moon, there
was a knock on the cabin door late one afternoon
Nzinga was cooking, Dominique had been lying on the sofa staring
emptily at the clouds moving in the sky
it was Amma standing before her, delighted to see her
fucking hell, Dominique shouted, it was so good to see her, they
collided in a hug
I was so worried about you, Dom, one postcard when you arrived and
that was it, you never answered my letters

The Hastings Cafeteria
There’s nothing more irritating than witnessing someone else’s unfair share
of happiness, and to some of their colleagues at Hastings Research Institute,
Elizabeth and Calvin had an unfair share. He, because he was brilliant; she,
because she was beautiful. When they became a couple, their unfair shares
automatically doubled, making it really unfair. The worst part, according to these people, was that they hadn’t earned
their shares—they’d simply been born that way, meaning their unfair share
of happiness arose, not from hard work, but from genetic luck. And the fact
that the duo decided to combine their unearned gifts into one loving and
probably highly sexual relationship, which the rest of them had to witness at
lunch every day, just made it that much worse. —
“Here they come,” said a geologist from the seventh floor. “Batman and
Robin.”
“I heard they’re shacking up together—did you know that?” asked his

rest of her would just have to hang on until a higher force decided that her life
was over. Dying would have been so easy for her, because she had so little to
lose, so little to live for. Except, somewhere, deep inside of her, she felt that she owed it to him to
survive, and to Molly. They had done so much for her, they were the first people
in her whole life who had really been there. She couldn't let them down now. She
couldn't let go of life yet, if only for their sakes. Just before they led her away, she gently touched his arm, and for an odd
instant, as he looked at her, he thought there was something almost saintly about
her. She had accepted her fate, and her destiny. And she looked dignified beyond
her years, and strangely beautiful as they led her away in handcuffs.",malice_6_7

His casual words hit her like a cyclone. She pulled out a stool and sat

a tiny corner of this or that as if it might lead to something much bigger
below. “I know you’ve already made your position clear,” he continued, “but I
thought you’d be interested to know we plan to upgrade a lot of the
equipment.” He pointed to a shelf where an out-of-date distillation
apparatus sat unused. As he raised his arm, a shiny cuff link peeked out
from under his suit sleeve. “Like that, for instance. That thing looks like it
hasn’t been touched in years.”
But Elizabeth had no reaction. She’d turned to stone. —
When Calvin was ten, he’d written about a tall, rich-looking man with shiny
cuff links who’d arrived at the boys home in a fancy limo. He seemed to

MALTA DUG HER makeshift paddle into the gleaming water and pushed

the cedar plank to the other side of the craft, frowning at the beads of water
that dripped from it into the boat when she did so. It couldn’t be helped. The
plank was all she had for an oar, and rowing on one side of the boat would
only spin them in circles. She refused to imagine that the acid drops were
even now eating into the planking underfoot. Surely, a tiny bit of Rain Wild

same concentration upon the hands, the same cold light on the face. The

Eleanor Dunton. Eleanor came over and the two of them read old copies of
Photoplay and Screen Secrets and giggled over the gossip columns and
gorged themselves on cold lobster salad. When Eddie got up for school the

before. Above the fireplace is a gilded Italian mirror. Every chair and
footstool is upholstered in peach silks and Prussian blue velvets. Equestrian
portraits (from which Doric columns and Sylvan glades are not entirely
absent) grace the walls. There is a card table of maplewood, a chequer table
of ebony and ivory, a spinette made by the Frenchman, Florent-Pasquier. At

telling, the hardest parts were over. In Fearrington, North Carolina, my
grandparents had lived by a pond, where geese plodded around with those
curved black necks, squeaky honking. My Grandpa Miller explained that
during migration, birds flew in V formation. The bird at the front, the tip of
the V, had the hardest job facing the greatest amount of wind resistance. The air coming off the leader’s flapping wings lifted the birds flying behind
it. Being the leader was grueling, so the birds took turns. When a bird
exhausted itself, it trailed to the back, where it wouldn’t have to flap as
hard, riding waves of wind that have been broken down by others. It saved
its energy so that it could lead again. This was the only way to make the

Kihrin skipped saying goodbye to Surdyeh, although his thoughts were on
his father the entire time he navigated the winding streets to the Upper
Circle. Under other circumstances, Surdyeh would have been overflowing
with supposedly helpful advice on how to behave around nobility. Under
other circumstances, Surdyeh would have lectured endlessly on etiquette in
his quest to ensure his son’s future as a musician. This always struck Kihrin
as hypocritical, when Surdyeh knew perfectly well his success in the
Revelers Guild depended on a magical aptitude that the old man refused to
let his son legally pursue.*
And Surdyeh had offered no advice for his son except “Don’t go.”
Kihrin never once considered that Surdyeh and Ola’s reasons for keeping
him from this meeting might have been legitimate. All he could see was
he’d been given a chance: a chance to impress Morea, a chance to win a

The glass corridor connecting the adult library to the Children’s Library

umbrella shape, whickering through the straining, whipping trees which
dotted the library grounds. Someone could have been severely hurt or even
killed by such a deadly fusillade, but there was no one there, either inside or
out. The library had not been opened that day at all. The tunnel which had
so fascinated Ben Hanscom as a boy would never be replaced; there had
been so much costly destruction in Derry that it seemed simpler to leave the
two libraries as separate unconnected buildings. In time, no one on the
Derry City Council could even remember what that glass umbilicus had
been for. Perhaps only Ben himself could really have told them how it was
to stand outside in the still cold of a January night, your nose running, the
tips of your fingers numb inside your mittens, watching the people pass
back and forth inside, walking through winter with their coats off and
surrounded by light. He could have told them... but maybe it wasn’t the sort
of thing you could have gotten up and testified about at a City Council
meeting—how you stood out in the cold dark and learned to love the light. All of that’s as may be; the facts were just these: the glass corridor blew up
for no apparent reason, no one was hurt (which was a blessing, since the

Calvin Evans also worked at Hastings Research Institute, but unlike

he had already contributed critical research that helped famed British
chemist Frederick Sanger clinch the Nobel Prize; at twenty-two, he
discovered a faster way to synthesize simple proteins; at twenty-four, his
breakthrough concerning the reactivity of dibenzoselenophene put him on

offered a fellowship at Harvard. Twice. Which he turned down.",Lessons_in_Chemistry_2_8

played hooky from school to go out hunting with his Uncle Dale. That deer
had been a scrawny doe whose meat had been wild-tasting and rather
bitter … from eating nettles, Uncle Dale said. This one was a buck, fine and
heavy and broad-chested. But then, Stu thought as he gutted it with a big
knife he had liberated from a Grand Junction sporting goods store, the
winter had just started. Nature had her own way of dealing with
overpopulation. Tom built a fire while Stu butchered the deer as best he could, getting the
sleeves of his heavy coat stiff and tacky with blood. By the time he was

go out the door, not this door. I’m at home, one of my homes, and she’s
running to meet me, in her small green nightgown with the sunflower on the
front, her feet bare, and I pick her up and feel her arms and legs go around me
and I begin to cry, because I know then that I’m not awake. I’m back in this
bed, trying to wake up, and I wake up and sit on the edge of the bed, and my
mother comes in with a tray and asks me if I’m feeling better. When I was
sick, as a child, she had to stay home from work. But I’m not awake this time
either. After these dreams I do awake, and I know I’m really awake because

Small trees had attacked my parents’ house at the foundation. They were
just seedlings with one or two rigid, healthy leaves. Nevertheless, the stalky
shoots had managed to squeeze through knife cracks in the decorative
brown shingles covering the cement blocks. They had grown into the
unseen wall and it was difficult to pry them loose. My father wiped his
palm across his forehead and damned their toughness. I was using a rusted
old dandelion fork with a splintered handle; he wielded a long, slim iron
fireplace poker that was probably doing more harm than good. As my father
prodded away blindly at the places where he sensed roots might have
penetrated, he was surely making convenient holes in the mortar for next
year’s seedlings. Whenever I succeeded in working loose a tiny tree, I placed it like a
trophy beside me on the narrow sidewalk that surrounded the house. There

were ash shoots, elm, maple, box elder, even a good-sized catalpa, which
my father placed in an ice cream bucket and watered, thinking that he might
find a place to replant it. I thought it was a wonder the treelets had persisted

On the late afternoon of September 10, Dinny was playing in the small
city park that lies just north of the city’s hotel and casino district. His
“mother” that week, Angelina Hirschfield, was sitting on a park bench and
talking with a young girl who had drifted into Las Vegas about five weeks
before, ten days or so after Angie herself had come in. Angie Hirschfield was twenty-seven. The girl was ten years younger,
now clad in tight bluejeans shorts and a brief middy blouse which left
absolutely nothing to the imagination. There was something obscene about
the contrast between the tight allure of her young body and the childish,
pouty, and rather vacuous expression on her face. Her conversation was
monotonous and seemingly without end: rock stars, sex, her lousy job
cleaning Cosmoline preservative off armaments at Indian Springs, sex, her
diamond ring, sex, the TV programs that she missed so much, and sex. Angie wished she would go have sex with someone and leave her alone. And she hoped Dinny would be at least thirty before he ever worked around
to having this girl for a mother. At that moment Dinny looked up, smiled, and yelled: “Tom! Hey, Tom!”

least objection, so many financial reporters seemed content to regurgitate the statements issued by CEOs and stockmarket speculators—even when this information was plainly misleading or wrong. These reporters were thus either
so naive and gullible that they ought to be packed off to other assignments, or they were people who quite consciously
betrayed their journalistic function. Blomkvist claimed that he had often been ashamed to be called a financial reporter,
since then he would risk being lumped together with people whom he did not rate as reporters at all. He compared the efforts of financial journalists with the way crime reporters or foreign correspondents worked. He
painted a picture of the outcry that would result if a legal correspondent began uncritically reproducing the prosecutor’s
case as gospel in a murder trial, without consulting the defence arguments or interviewing the victim’s family before
forming an opinion of what was likely or unlikely. According to Blomkvist the same rules had to apply to financial

journalists. The rest of the book consisted of a chain of evidence to support his case. One long chapter examined the reporting
of a famous dot-com in six daily papers, as well as in the Financial Journal, Dagens Industri, and “A-ekonomi,” the
business report on Swedish TV. He first quoted and summarised what the reporters had said and written. Then he

In 1988, George H. W. Bush had just won the presidential election by
inviting everyone to read his lips while Michael Dukakis lost it by riding in
a tank. Dr. Huxtable was America’s dad, Kate & Allie were America’s
moms, The Golden Girls were America’s grandmoms, McDonald’s
announced it was opening its first restaurant in the Soviet Union, everyone
bought Stephen Hawking’s A Brief History of Time and didn’t read it,
Phantom of the Opera opened on Broadway, and Patricia Campbell got
ready to die. She sprayed her hair, put on her earrings, and blotted her lipstick, but
when she looked at herself in the mirror she didn’t see a housewife of
thirty-nine with two children and a bright future, she saw a dead person. Unless war broke out, the oceans rose, or the earth fell into the sun, tonight
was the monthly meeting of the Literary Guild of Mt. Pleasant, and she
hadn’t read this month’s book. And she was the discussant. Which meant
that in less than ninety minutes she would stand up in front of a room full of
women and lead them in a conversation about a book she hadn’t read. She had meant to read Cry, the Beloved Country—honestly—but every
time she picked up her copy and read There is a lovely road that runs from
Ixopo into the hills, Korey rode her bike off the end of the dock because she
thought that if she pedaled fast enough she could skim across the water, or
she set her brother’s hair on fire trying to see how close she could get a

called that her mother couldn’t come to the phone because she was dead,

This book is set in 1988, but the tangle of laws that hinder prosecution of
rape cases on many reservations still exists. “Maze of Injustice,” a 2009
report by Amnesty International, included the following statistics: 1 in 3
Native women will be raped in her lifetime (and that figure is certainly
higher as Native women often do not report rape); 86 percent of rapes and
sexual assaults upon Native women are perpetrated by non-Native men; few
are prosecuted. In 2010, then North Dakota senator Byron Dorgan
sponsored the Tribal Law and Order Act. In signing the act into law,
President Barack Obama called the situation “an assault on our national
conscience.” The organizations highlighted in boldface below are working
to restore sovereign justice and ensure safety for Native women. Thank you to the many people who advised me as I wrote this book: Betty

voluntary manslaughter, and that was how they had charged her. They believed, as the judge had explained in his instructions to them, that
Grace had believed falsely, and therein lay the key, that she was justified in
killing her father. Because of his glowing reputation in the community, they had
been unable to accept that her father had been truly harming her, but they did
believe that Grace had believed that, though incorrectly. Voluntary manslaughter
carried a sentence of up to twenty years, at the judge's discretion. And in the end, because of her extreme youth, and the fact that Grace herself
had believed it to be both a crime of passion and of justifiable defense, the judge
gave her two years in prison, and two years probation. Considering the

of the dead. In the girls’-school version we read, he saw her picking
wildflowers one day and captured her, bringing her back to his home in
Hell, where she was forced to remain after she ate six pomegranate seeds. That word, captured, was all we ever read, but the paintings we’d studied
all called the encounter rape. Our teachers never elaborated on the meaning
of that word, but I, at least, understood it, and I couldn’t imagine that none
of the other girls did. That woman in the corner of the painting was
Demeter, Persephone’s mother, the goddess of harvest; after Hades dragged
her daughter to Hell, she mourned so fiercely that the earth plunged into
perpetual winter. When he saw that the people were starving and freezing to
death, Zeus, god of the sky, struck a bargain between Hades and Demeter:
because Persephone had only eaten six seeds, she would remain with her
captor for six months of the year and with her mother for the other six. Zeus
sliced her in half, as Solomon had offered to cleave apart the baby claimed
by two mothers. But in the version I told myself, staring at the horrible fresco, Persephone
gathered up the flowing excess of Hades’s rich robes in her empty hands,
looped them around his neck, and strangled him.",Reader_I_Murdered_Him_5_69

believe there’s been another. The shock had dimmed. No longer a bang, but
an ache. If kids getting killed by trains became normalized, anything could. This was no longer a fight against my rapist, it was a fight to be

""Shhh, Matthew!"" they all said at once, and watched in horror as the story
unraveled. The story was definitely not pretty. It opened with the news that Grace
Mackenzie, wife of Congressman Charles Mackenzie, candidate for a Senate

had been sentenced to two years in prison. There were photographs of her going

long and hating it, and Sonny went down a mine to work; they should have
come back to live the outside life, to use their bodies as God intended,
working on the land, and investing in an inheritance neither deserves
Ada Mae and Sonny got shoved down into mud once when they were
young at the winter fair
one minute they were standing behind her, eagerly awaiting the candy
floss she was buying, the next they were on the ground covered in mud and
tears
the culprit had disappeared into the crowds

axe and beheaded him with the strength of a woman who’s been chopping
firewood since her father gave her an axe for her tenth birthday
she’d have thrown him in the trough for the hogs to demolish all traces,
who’ll go through bone like butter
she’d have thrown carrots and cabbage in while she was at it (meat and
two veg)

starving sows
no need for the palaver of digging graves in the woods in the middle of
the night, or dissolving bodies in metal drums full of acid, like on those
American crime documentaries that make her feel grateful to be living so
far away from such goings-on
Slim was less sympathetic when his children came home with their ‘sob
stories’, as he put it, such as when a child pinched Ada Mae’s arm to see if
she bruised, or scratched her with a compass to see if she could bleed, and if
so, what was the colour? or the boys asked Sonny if his colour could be scrubbed off, held him
down, applied a scrubbing brush to see for themselves

rise above it, Slim said as they sat around the table at teatime to have a
glass of cold milk and jam sandwiches in the one hour of the day they
convened as a family before more farm work beckoned
cow-milking being first on the list

Hattie asked him to tone it down with the stories, it was scaring their
children and would make them hate themselves, he said they needed to
toughen up and what did she know about it with her being high-yaller and
living in the back of beyond? you liked that I’m high-yaller, as you put it, so don’t you go using it

he said the Negro had reason to be angry, having spent four hundred
years in America enslaved, victimized and kept downtrodden
it was a powder keg waiting to explode
she replied they were a million miles from America and it’s different

he said his little brother Sonny was the children’s uncle and they needed
to know what happened to him and about the history of a country that
allowed him to be murdered, and it’s your duty to face up to racial issues,
Hattie, because our children are darker than you and aren’t going to have it
as easy
they had these conversations until she was able to see things from his
point of view

they both followed the news about the civil rights protests, Slim said the
Negro needed Malcolm X and Martin Luther King
when they were assassinated within three years of each other
he disappeared into the hills for a few days
Hattie saw that neither of her children liked being coloured and she
didn’t know what to do about it
Ada Mae painted herself as a white child in her drawings, and from the
age of twelve Sonny never wanted to be seen with his father beyond the
village, hated having to go to the cattle fairs with him as a teenager and he
begged her not to bring his father to school events
she overheard Sonny telling a boy whose father dropped him home one
day that Slim, who was leading sheep out to pasture, was a hired labourer
Slim would have given his life for his children. 3
When Ada Mae and Sonny were sixteen and seventeen, they announced
out of the blue one breakfast that they were leaving home
we’re going today and you can’t stop us, Sonny said, spreading his legs
wide like he was a grown man, shoulders back, daring his parents to
challenge him
we’re not going to spend another day in the back of beyond baling hay,
ploughing fields, milking cows and mucking out animal dung
for the rest of our lives

Hattie remembers it so clearly
Ada Mae wore her new orange mini-dress with a high neck she’d
ordered though the Biba catalogue, white patent leather boots that rode up
to her knees, hair sculpted into a beehive, false lashes, black pencil around
her eyes making them appear huge
she was beautiful then, of course she didn’t think so
it’s only now, when they look at old family photos together that Ada
Mae exclaims, with more than a touch of sadness, look at me, Ma, I was
quite lovely, wasn’t I? Sonny was bone-thin in those days, in the way of teenage boys before
they become men, his legs gangly and uncoordinated, he’d grown too
quickly to the height of his father
he wore his purple velvet flare suit, his hair was trimmed almost to the
bone back then, to hide its kinks, she suspected
with a side-parting that looked absurd
neither were dressed for the long ride to London
they left on Sonny’s seventeenth birthday present – the Honda
motorbike he’d begged them to buy him
said he needed it to come and go more freely

it cost them two bullhorns
Ada Mae sat pillion, Sonny revved the bike and the pair of them roared
off out of the yard, down the hill, through the village and towards the
glamorous streets that awaited them in London
Ada Mae was to become a secretary to a pop star, Sonny a rich
businessman
they roared noisily out of their parents’ lives leaving a plume of smoke
and fumes
leaving her and Slim marooned on eight hundred acres of farmland
it took time to adjust to not hearing Ada Mae playing Dusty Springfield,
Petula Clark and Cilla Black records on the record player in the Long
Room, where she danced in the modern way
if one of them made the mistake of entering, she shouted at them to
bloody well leave her alone for once
Sonny pretended to play the guitar in there, while listening to the
Rolling Stones
they used to peep through the windows to amuse themselves
Hattie and Slim found it strange sitting down to meals for two instead of
four, washing one set of sheets instead of three, to not taking the
temperature of teenage moods when their kids were sloping about at home
they never stopped worrying about them being so far away in the capital
city
where anything could happen to them
London didn’t last, they didn’t even make it to three whole months
(lightweights!)
Sonny worked in a boutique in Carnaby Street that didn’t pay enough to
live on, Ada Mae washed dishes in the kitchen of the Regent Palace Hotel
it was impossible to get accommodation other than in a run-down house
with coloured immigrants in a slum area called Notting Hill
the immigrants scornfully accused them of being like white people
Hattie wanted to say she thought they’d see that as a compliment and
contemplated how her bairns had gone from the Scottish Borders to
London, only to discover it was an alien country down there
she was happy when they settled in Newcastle, only seventy miles from
the farm

instead of over three hundred
Ada Mae married Tommy, the first man who asked, grateful anyone
would
she didn’t exactly have suitors lining up in Newcastle wanting to
proudly introduce their black girlfriend to their parents in the nineteensixties
Tommy was on the ugly side, a face like a garden gnome, her and Slim
joked, none too bright, either
Hattie suspected the lad didn’t have too many choices himself
a coalminer from young, he was apprenticed as a welder when the
mines were shut down
he proved to be a good husband and really did love Ada Mae, in spite of
her colour
as he told Hattie and Slim when he came to ask for her hand
lucky that Slim didn’t lay him out

there and then
Sonny’s experience was somewhat different, according to Ada Mae who
reported back that women queued up round the block for him
they thought he was the next best thing to dating Johnny Mathis
he married Janet, a barmaid, whose parents objected
and told her to choose. 4
When she first saw him, Slim Jackson reminded Hattie of the Masai
warriors she’d seen in the National Geographic magazine Pa had ordered
monthly from America in her childhood
they’d pore over the photographs together on Sunday afternoons after
church and explore the pictures and stories of places and people beyond the
farm, village and surrounding towns
Pa had travelled across Europe in the army, he’d been to Egypt and
Gallipoli, developed an appetite for things foreign
Hattie met Slim in 1945 at an afternoon dance in Newcastle for
demobbed American Negro regiments who were due to be sent home
it was her first dance in the big city, her parents sat outside in the farm
truck, praying she’d meet someone
she’d had no luck so far
Hattie was astonished at the number of other coloured Englishwomen
there, who’d travelled from as far afield as Cardiff, Bristol, Glasgow,
Liverpool, London
they were all kinds of mixtures, most with a white mother, which came
out when they got chatting in the powder room
Hattie felt instantly comfortable among these girls, who all looked like
versions of herself, she’d never felt so welcomed
they were surprised she worked on a farm, felt sorry for her as they reapplied lipstick and powdered their faces in the mirror, posing like they
were all beauty queens whereas she looked plain, wore no make-up, which
really won’t do, one of the girls said, and set to brightening up features
Hattie had thought of as plain
the women cooed over her and said now you look pretty, Hattie

when she looked at the red on her cheeks and her lips in the mirror, she
agreed
the other girls wore glamorous taffeta dresses which showed off their
waists, and long white gloves, and stilettos
Hattie felt embarrassed by the dowdy dress Ma had made her from
Woman’s Weekly
inside the hall the band played swing music, the dance floor was a swirl
of girls in dresses as colourful as butterflies and smart green soldiers’
uniforms, everyone pairing up, none of the girls were left as wallflowers,
which had been Hattie’s fate at local barn dances
only her father would take her for a spin
the girls agreed that most Englishmen wouldn’t touch them with a
bargepole, other than to expect easy sex, and African or West Indian men
were few and far between
every one of them was a belle of the ball at this dance, as the soldiers
made quite clear, in thrall to such high-class, light-skinned ladies
the women laughed at the compliments, were used to being treated as
the lowest of the low
some said this was their last chance before the soldiers departed for the
United States of America
some dreamed of being taken back there as wives
Hattie sat at a table with three Irish-Nigerian sisters, Annie, Bettina and
Juliana, all training to be nurses, who were more full of life than anyone
she’d ever met, she found herself giggling at their outrageous flirting with
the soldiers
she invited them to visit her at the farm
they scoffed at the very idea, a farm? oh Hattie, how funny you are,
we’re going forwards not backwards, you’re a pet
we’re going to London once we’re qualified, we’ll write so you can visit
us
to this day she wonders what happened to them
Slim approached her to do the foxtrot
she was flattered, shy at first, avoided his gaze, he openly admired her
creamy complexion, girl, those blushing cheeks alone will give you high
stock value back home in Georgia
he was long and thin, his skin shiny and silky

he was the first man to make her feel ladylike instead of like a
workhorse who spent all day getting dirt underneath her fingernails
they married within the year, Ma and Pa approved, glad she’d found
someone to look after her when they were gone
Slim liked her parents and they liked him for who he was
Pa said he was the son he never had, and once took Hattie aside, said he
was relieved that Slim didn’t try and boss her around
fat chance that, she replied
for his part, Slim didn’t like the English weather, but he liked the
people, said he felt more respected here, he hadn’t been called boy once and
when he rode his bicycle thereabouts, he wasn’t worried folks were gonna
don white hoods, burn crosses and lynch him
it’s why I’m never going home, Hattie
Slim came from sharecropping stock, his people farmed land but never
owned it
his father had to give half his sugar cane yield to the landowner, was in
never-ending debt to the merchant who sold them seeds, clothes and tools,
and ran the risk of eviction if the crop failed
Slim said many of his people left the land after slavery because it
reminded them of it
the government had promised them all forty acres and a mule
it was the bitterest pill when it didn’t deliver, folks had to stay wage
slaves
now he was married to Hattie, the land he worked was one day going to
be his
hers too, she reminded him
most people took favourably to Slim, he was confident and talkative,
spoke to strangers, even hostile ones, diffusing their animosity, especially
when they heard his accent, they praised his courteousness, his yes m’ams
and no sirs, they liked the way he opened doors for women, tipped his hat at
men, making them feel respected
especially when he sang in his stirring baritone in church, at harvest
festivals, Christmas carols, birthday parties, barn dances, strumming a
guitar or a washboard as accompaniment
she and him enjoyed their conjugals for the most part, once they
discovered that him putting it in and taking it out wasn’t enough for her
it only waned when his mental prowess did

they were together over forty years, she’s not been touched in a sensual
way in the thirty years since
she can still feel his manly farmer’s hands holding her naked buttocks,
complaining there wasn’t enough meat on them
although he admired her physical strength
Slim boasted she could steer a plough as good as any man
hotdamn, Hattie, hotdamn! 5
Hattie started walking when Slim died
she bought walking boots as opposed to working boots, carved herself a
walking stick with a Black Power fist on the knob – in homage to him
she wore thermals in winter, cotton shirts in summer, carried rainwear
and a flask of the sweet tea Slim used to drink in her knapsack
as she trod her land and beyond
sometimes in high summer she’d go out to one of her fields at night, lie
on a blanket, watch the stars in the night sky, imagine Slim looking down at
her

watching over her

waiting for her
she kept farm production going a long time, well into her eighties, at
one point she had thirty farmhands on her payroll

arrest because . . . my mind was going a million miles an hour, and it was
impossible for me to think clearly about what happened. Meanwhile victims
are always expected to think clearly, we don’t get to use fear as an excuse. Senseless violence continues to play out, while you ask for more and more
evidence, telling us it’s not enough, try again. Even when sexual assault claims are brought to police, only a small
percentage will be taken up by prosecutors. This is not because prosecutors
do not believe the victims, it is because they know the burden of proof is
extremely high, as one must prove the assault occurred beyond a reasonable
doubt. Prosecutors will not put you through the entire process if evidence is
scant and chances are low to begin with, which means even if the victim
wants to move forward, it is not always up to her. That leaves filing a lawsuit in civil court, which requires a lower

dangerous, too. I refused to see the abuse in my life, several times over,
because I loved my abusers; when I trained as a rape crisis counselor, I saw
many survivors do the same thing. Sometimes survivors refuse to
acknowledge their own pain out of love for those who hurt them. All too
often, the people around them refuse to believe them, because of that same
love. Jane Eyre, of course, is one of the most iconic stories about a woman told

Mikael Blomkvist was released from Rullåker Prison on Friday, May 16, two months after he was admitted. The same
day he entered the facility, he had submitted an application for parole, with no great optimism. He never did quite
understand the technical reasons behind his release, but it may have had something to do with the fact that he did not
use any holiday leave and that the prison population was forty-two while the number of beds was thirty-one. In any
case, the warden—Peter Sarowsky, a forty-year-old Polish exile—with whom Blomkvist got along well, wrote a
recommendation that his sentence be reduced. His time at Rullåker had been unstressful and pleasant enough. The prison had been designed, as Sarowsky
expressed it, for hooligans and drunk drivers, not for hardened criminals. The daily routines reminded him of living in a
youth hostel. His fellow prisoners, half of whom were second-generation immigrants, regarded Blomkvist as
something of a rare bird in the group. He was the only inmate to appear on the TV news, which lent him a certain

actions led to trouble, and trouble could have unpleasant consequences. She never did anything without first weighing
the consequences. The initial sexual assault—which in legal terms would be defined as sexual molestation and the exploitation of an
individual in a position of dependence, and could in theory get Bjurman up to two years in prison—lasted only a few
seconds. But it was enough to irrevocably cross a boundary. For Salander it was a display of strength by an enemy
force—an indication that aside from their carefully defined legal relationship, she was at the mercy of his discretion

sadly, Mum has more pulling power than her and is actually considered
hot in the lesbian world
her girlfriends du jour, as Dad puts it (hey, why speak English when you
can speak French?), are two white women, Dolores and Jackie, although
Mum has been with every ethnicity known to humankind (it’s called
multiracial whoredom)
they’re all very cosy together which is quite heart-warming seeing as
Mum’s women have gone to war over her
it’s strange, and suspicious, because with Dolores and Jackie there are
no screaming matches, no ranting answerphone messages, no one trying to
kick in the front door in the middle of the night, and no one skulking in a
corner looking daggers at her rival at Mum’s parties
it’s like they actually like each other, Yazz suspects they have gruesome
threesomes, and can’t bring herself to ask
besides, she’s lost count of the women who’ve come and gone to the
point that the new ones barely register on her Richter scale of annoyance
there’ll inevitably be a new face around the breakfast table trying to
befriend the daughter of their new lover, running around making her toast,
omelette with cheese and tomatoes, pouring her juice, washing up the
dishes after her
the daughter who’ll drop numerous unsubtle hints when her
birthday/Christmas/Easter are approaching
(and why isn’t the marmalade on the table?)
when Yazz talks about her unusual upbringing to people, the unworldly
ones expect her to be emotionally damaged from it, like how can you not be
when your mum’s a polyamorous lesbian and your father’s a gay narcissist
(as she describes him), and you were shunted between both their homes and
dumped with various godparents while your parents pursued their careers? this annoys Yazz who can’t stand people saying anything negative about
her parents
that’s her prerogative
anyway, she’s resigned herself to hanging out with the squad at uni
rather than going out manhunting
it’s unfortunate that she’s coming of age as one of the Swipe-Like-ChatInvite-Fuck Generation where men expect you to give it up on the first (and
only) date, have no pubic hair at all, and do the disgusting things they’ve
seen women do in porn movies on the internet

which she suspects the boys in her halls watch all day and all night,
boys who are rarely seen outside their rooms (lectures? what lectures?)
she’s only been on one date at uni, which involved sitting at a bar with a
male specimen she’d thought was an interesting person, who was obviously
swiping his phone to see if someone more fanciable was in the vicinity
before making his pathetic excuses about having to do revision
she left shortly after he did, saw him chatting up a woman in a bar a few
doors down when she passed on her way home

ovaries will be busted and they’ll be on to women half their age who can

slutty ho, part alien), she’s having to compete with images of girls on

relationship in the long term (her mother she is not), she’s got herself a
booty call in Steve, an American who’s studying for a PhD on ‘the
interrelationship and aesthetics of hip hop and racial politics in the eighties’
unfortunately, he’s also got a girlfriend in Chicago, which provokes
something of a moral conundrum when they’re in bed together, and she
calls and he lies about what he’s doing
Yazz sometimes has sleepless nights worrying she’ll be alone for the
whole of her life
if she can’t get a proper boyfriend at nineteen what hope is there for
when she’s older? a couple of Mum’s female friends have been single for decades, not the
lesbians who have little problem getting off with each other, but the straight
ones who’ve got good jobs and houses and no partner to share it with, who
say they’re not prepared to settle at this stage in their lives

of having to actually find a job after uni and earn her own money, like the
rest of them, brought her round

Yazz was drawn to Waris on the second day of Fresher Week at the
welcome party in the sports hall where they both skulked on the periphery;
Yazz gravitated towards Waris’s resting bitch face, as she later told her,
which Waris took in good humour, asking Yazz if she’d looked in the mirror
recently
they agreed that their peers were really immature, while sipping iced tea
in a corner of a Starbucks on campus far away from the bedlam of the other
freshers running around with their foam parties, disco paintballing, treasure
hunts and group pub crawls that were bound to end up with A&E
emergencies, Yazz predicted
whose idea was it? she wrote on the official Fresher Week feedback
form
to introduce these poor young things to alcohol poisoning the first week
they’re away from home? why don’t you also book them into rehab now instead of waiting for the
first signs of liver damage to show in their second year? Waris
matches her headscarves with the colour of her flowing clothes
she has green days, brown days, blue days, floral days, fluorescent days
– never black days (she’s not a traditionalist)
she often sticks her phone just inside her hijab to carry out hands-free
conversations, which Yazz tells her is an excellent blend of religiosity and
practicality
to which Waris replies that she wears a hijab to make a statement about
her Muslim identity, and while there are those who make out it’s a proper
religious thing, there’s nothing about women covering up in the Koran, you
know? Waris doesn’t ever leave her room without applying a smooth paste of
foundation on to her already perfect complexion
whole tubes of mascara to thicken already forested eyelashes
and her eyebrows are painted into a high arch that practically stretches
all the way to her ears
Waris says she’s ugly without her ‘face on’, even though Yazz reassures
her that Somali women are the most beautiful in the world, and that
includes you too, Waris
Waris says she’s fat, even though she’s perfectly normal-sized, pinching
her thighs so hard they go mottled then showing Yazz her ‘cellulite’, which
is non-existent, Waris, it’s just flesh being squeezed so tightly it nearly pops
she sometimes wears sunglasses when there’s no sun – at night and
inside buildings
she even tried it on in class, looking fierce and super-cool until one
brave lecturer, Dr Sandra Reynolds (call me Sandy, guys and gals), showed
she wasn’t the pushover they thought she was when she ordered Waris to
take them off unless she had a medical condition and certificate to prove it

or to leave her class
it’s to make myself look fearless, Waris explained to Yazz after they’d
treated themselves to a pizza one Saturday lunchtime and were making their
way back to campus on the slippery and rainy cobbled streets of the
university town where they stood out
or maybe it’s to hide your fear, Yazz suggested, you’re actually feeling
fear-ful, the words are separated by a few letters, fear-ful or fear-less,
similar but diametrically different, see? Yazz felt a surge of preternatural wisdom beyond her years
it was one of those moments
Waris looked pensive as they walked on in silence, and then replied,
equally sagaciously, perhaps it’s both
in that moment Yazz understood why they got on so well, they were on
the same intellectual wavelength
life was different before 9/11, Waris said, as they left the town behind
and walked along a busy main road passing big old houses made of thick
slabs of grey stone; she was too young to remember the ‘before era’, when
her mother said people looked at hijabbed women with surprise, curiosity or
pity
then there was the ‘after era’, when her mother said they began to be
viewed with a blatant hostility that gets worse every time a jihadist blows
white people up, or mows them down in a truck
at times like these Waris braces herself to get even more shoved, spat at
and called names such as dirty Arab when I’m not even Arab, Yazz
Waris said it’s crazy that people are so stupid to think over one and a
half billion Muslims all think and act the same way, a Muslim man carries
out a mass shooting or blows people up and he’s called a terrorist, a white
man does the exact same thing and he’s called a madman
both sets are mad, Yazz
I know, Waris, I know
Yazz sees the dirty looks Waris gets when they’re walking through town
she gives dirty looks back on her friend’s behalf
Waris said her grandmother rarely left their council flat in
Wolverhampton any more, it was too hard for her to walk the street and get
such hostility, and she’s never stopped mourning everything she’s lost
she lived a well-off lifestyle in Mogadishu until 1991, in a family where
all the adult men worked in the family dental practice, until they were killed

and she fled here with her daughters
these days her grandmother pops prescription pills
she sits in the living room disappearing into herself

into us kids that we could either decide to be crushed by the weight of
history, and modern-day atrocities, or we could go into warrior pose
Dad works in a factory, Mum has two jobs, the first is working in a
refuge for Muslim women and the second is teaching self-defence to
women who cover up, so they can learn how to protect themselves from the
‘hijab grab’ and related assaults
she teaches a mixture of Krav Maga, Jiu Jitsu, Aikido and Pencak Silat
at the local community centre, Waris said proudly; Waris herself learned
mixed martial arts alongside her mother
Yazz and Waris arrive back at the campus and walk down the lane, rain
abating, skies clearing, rainbow appearing
they pass the gym with students in sporty gear entering and leaving
they pass the laundry, students in a zombie daze watching the machines
rotate or playing with their phones
they pass the arts centre with a gallery and a café inside it selling
unaffordable coffee and unaffordable cakes for the posh people who come
on to campus to use it

weed drifting out, until they get to theirs

if anyone tells her she’s responsible for them being unemployed

UCLA because when men rape women, they prefer women not to tell. Roth swallowed hard. “As for my background, it was my brother who raised me,” she

He shouldered the rifle and started off again, now angling left toward the

group of friends, biking to Blockbuster to rent Carrie, eating Cheetos,
tucked inside sleeping bags in the little guesthouse. When my story first broke, I watched from my bed as news cameras

elegantly slim-line and initially so unstable it closed for two years
shortly after opening because no one suspected that so many people
crossing it at the same time would begin to walk in lockstep
and the effect, like armies of marching soldiers stamping the ground in
sync, created vibrations that caused the bridge to sway
it’s how she sees herself, walking in silent lockstep with the people who
are going places
she watches the stream of people crossing the bridge this morning, most
of whom are more engaged with their phones, taking selfies, tourist pics,
posting, texting, than actually taking in the views either side of the bridge
people have to share everything they do these days, from meals, to
nights out, to selfies of themselves half naked in a mirror
the borders between public and private are dissolving

pathways, implanted at the cellular level a month after conception, selfgrowing, self-repairing

ways, instead of primal beings who cannot be so easily controlled

perhaps it will stop little girls feeling it’s their fault

one thing she’s learnt is that falling hopelessly, helplessly in love is
actually a highly selective process
she was never going to marry a street cleaner, was she? she met Freddy at a party a couple of years into her job when she was
living back home with her mother to save money

she was flattered that this handsome, preppy and genuinely plummy
man was interested in her when the room was full of stunning debutante
types eyeing him up
she said yes to the Curzon Soho cinema date to see a Venezuelan film
on a Sunday afternoon
yes to the leisurely walk through the backstreets of the West End to
Hyde Park
yes to dinner in a Lebanese restaurant on Edgware Road and thereafter
late-night drinks at his father’s club in Pall Mall
yes to his knockout humour and genuine interest in her life and opinions
yes to his intelligence, conversational skills and easy-going personality
yes to his romantic hand-holding and all-round good manners
yes to his obvious infatuation with her
he told her he was raised in a villa in Richmond with a lawn that swept
down to the Thames with its own jetty where a motorboat was moored for
excursions
he was enthralled by her own childhood on a Peckham housing estate,
impressed that she’d made it against so many obstacles
he said he had merely stepped rather casually into the grooves of a preordained track laid down by his family, beginning with an eccentric
boarding school in Wiltshire attended by almost every male in his family
since 1880, a school that taught Latin and Ancient Greek for twenty-one out
of the thirty-one classes a week when his father was there
thankfully cut back to only seven classes in Freddy’s time
after a whirlwind world tour during his gap year, he flew to a private
New England liberal arts college, most generously endowed by his alumnus
father the year his Straight C son applied
the son who graduated four years later with an embarrassingly low
Grade Point Average on account of being side-tracked by about thirty other
teenage boys left to their own devices for the first time in a frat house where
he partied most nights and ingested various mind-altering substances which
often left him out of it for days
barely able to speak, let alone write
not that it mattered
in his final semester he was offered a well-remunerated starter position
in the City as a result of his mother calling in a favour from a school friend
who’d been one of her bridesmaids

she said Freddy could start the day he landed back in Old England from
New England
no interview necessary, he’ll just need to do a bit of boring old formfilling, darling
ever since, he’s found the corporate lifestyle so stultifying and souldestroying, he dreams of living in a wigwam in a field and growing his own
food
Carole moved directly from her mother’s flat where she stayed rent free
for a couple of years after graduation to save for a mortgage
into Freddy’s house in Fulham where the relationship moved into the
engagement phase
I’ll be the househusband in the relationship, he promised, hang prettily
off your arm when required, mow the lawn, make jam, supervise the
housekeeper and raise our lovely tawny offspring
she loved that he was prepared to be subservient to her ambition
she knew she’d go further faster with him at her side
he said his parents wanted him to marry someone whose lineage, like
theirs, could be traced back to William the Conqueror

did not foresee the long-term negative impact of her daughter going to
the famous university for rich people
especially when she returned home after her first term wailing that she
could not go back because she did not belong there
whereupon Bummi applied a tissue or two to her daughter’s eyes and
cheeks and asked her outright and forthrightly, Carole, have I raised a
fighter or a quitter? you must return to the university and get your degree by
hook or by crook or I cannot vouch for the consequences of my actions
Bummi did not subsequently expect Carole to return home after her
second term speaking out of her nose like there was a sneeze trapped up it

while looking haughtily around their cosy little flat as if it was now a fleapit

internal mind? eh! eh!, you do not raise a child without becoming an expert

that first summer holiday Carole worked in Marks & Spencer in
Lewisham, not to start paying off her student debt like a responsible adult,

but to buy clothes from those expensive fashion shops called Oasis and
Zara, instead of getting bargains at New Look and Peacock
in her second year she barely came home at all and by her final year she
was spending weekends and holidays at her friend Rosie’s family manor in
the countryside, which had more rooms than a housing estate, she said, it’s
simply divine, Mother, simply divine
(Mother – was she being ironical?)
when Bummi watched her daughter collect her degree at graduation,
tears streamed down her face so heavily it was like rain lashing a car
window

without the windscreen wipers
she wished Augustine was there to witness their little girl making it, she
also wished Carole had come home to continue celebrations with the pot of
bush stew Bummi had cooked specially, hoping that now her daughter had
graduated, she would return to her real culture and even eat with her hands
again instead of side-glancing her mama for doing so, as if she was a savage
from the jungle
before she got on the train back to London, Bummi impressed upon
Carole for the umpteenth time that now she had to acquire a high-flying job
and then a respectable Nigerian husband in order to give her grandchildren
Carole had introduced no boyfriends to her mother thus far, which
meant they were of little importance to her daughter
nearly a week later, Carole returned to the flat red-eyed and ‘exhausted’

weekly calls to the housing office, she landed a one-bedroom housing
association flat in a small fifties block in Bloomsbury
I did what I had to find a home, she told Amma, not my finest moment,
I admit, still, no harm done, as my father will never know
she went on a mission to educate herself in black history, culture,
politics, feminism, discovered London’s alternative bookshops
she walked into Sisterwrite in Islington where every single author of
every single book was female and browsed for hours; she couldn’t afford to
buy anything, and read the whole of Home Girls: A Black Feminist
Anthology in weekly instalments, standing up, as well as anything by Audre
Lorde she could get her hands on
the booksellers didn’t seem to mind
when I was accepted into a very orthodox drama school, I was already
politicized and challenged them on everything, Amma
the only person of colour in the whole school
she demanded to know why the male parts in Shakespeare couldn’t be
played by women and don’t even get me started on cross-racial casting, she
shouted at the course director while everyone else, including the female
students, stayed silent
I realized I was on my own
the next day I was taken aside by the school principal
you’re here to become an actor not a politician
you’ll be asked to leave if you keep causing trouble

you have been warned, Dominique
tell me about it, Amma replied, shut up or get out, right? as for me, I get my fighting spirit from my dad, Kwabena, who was a
journalist campaigning for Independence in Ghana
until he heard he was going to be arrested for sedition, legged it over
here, ended up working on the railways where he met Mum at London
Bridge station
he was a ticket collector, she worked in the offices above the concourse
he made sure to be the one to take her ticket, she made sure to be the
last person to leave the train so she could exchange a few words with him
Mum, Helen, is half-caste, born in 1935 in Scotland
her father was a Nigerian student who vanished as soon as he finished
his studies at the University of Aberdeen
he never said goodbye
years later her mother discovered he’d gone back to his wife and
children in Nigeria
she didn’t even know he had a wife and children
Mum wasn’t the only half-caste in Aberdeen in the thirties and forties
but she was rare enough to be made to feel it
she left school early, went to secretarial college, headed down to
London, just as it was being populated by African men who’d come to
study or work
Mum went to their dances and Soho clubs, they liked her lighter skin
and looser hair
she says she felt ugly until African men told her she wasn’t
you should see what she looked like back then
a cross between Lena Horne and Dorothy Dandridge
so yeh, really ugly
Mum hoped to spend their first date going to see a film and then on to
her favourite spot, Club Afrique, right here in Soho, she’d dropped enough
hints and loved to dance to highlife and West African jazz
instead he took her to one of his socialist meetings in the backroom of a
pub at the Elephant and Castle
where a group of men sat guzzling beers and talking independence
politics
she sat there trying to act interested, impressed by his intellect
he was impressed with her silent acquiescence, if you ask me

they married and moved to Peckham
I was their last child and first girl, Amma explained, blowing smoke
into the already thickening fug of the room
my three older brothers became lawyers and a doctor, their obedience to
the expectations of our father meant I wasn’t pressurized to follow suit
his only concern for me is marriage and children
he thinks my acting career is a hobby until I have both
Dad’s a socialist who wants a revolution to improve the lot of all of
mankind
literally
I tell Mum she married a patriarch
look at it this way, Amma, she says, your father was born male in Ghana
in the 1920s whereas you were born female in London in the 1960s
and your point is? you really can’t expect him to ‘get you’, as you put it
I let her know she’s an apologist for the patriarchy and complicit in a
system that oppresses all women
she says human beings are complex
I tell her not to patronize me
Mum worked eight hours a day in paid employment, raised four
children, maintained the home, made sure the patriarch’s dinner was on the
table every night and his shirts were ironed every morning
meanwhile, he was off saving the world
his one domestic duty was to bring home the meat for Sunday lunch
from the butcher’s – a suburban kind of hunter-gatherer thing
I can tell Mum’s unfulfilled now we’ve all left home because she spends
her time either cleaning it or redecorating it
she’s never complained about her lot, or argued with him, a sure sign
she’s oppressed
she told me she tried to hold his hand in the early days, but he shook her
off, said affection was an English affectation, she never tried again
yet every year he gets her the soppiest Valentine card you can buy and
he loves sentimental country music, sits in the kitchen on Sunday evenings
listening to albums of Jim Reeves and Charley Pride
tumbler of whisky in one hand, wiping tears away with the other
Dad lives for campaigning meetings, demos, picketing Parliament and
standing in Lewisham Market selling the Socialist Worker

I grew up listening to his sermons during our evening meal on the evils
of capitalism and colonialism and the merits of socialism
it was his pulpit and we were his captive congregation
it was like we were literally being force-fed his politics
he’d probably be an important person in Ghana if he’d returned after
Independence
instead he’s President for Life of our family
he doesn’t know I’m a dyke, are you kidding? Mum told me not to tell
him, it was hard enough telling her, she said she suspected when pencil
skirts and curly perms were all the rage and I started wearing men’s Levis
she’s sure it’s a phase, which I’ll throw back at her when I’m forty
Dad has no time for ‘the fairies’ and laughs at all the homophobic jokes
comedians make on telly every Saturday night when they’re not insulting
their motherin-law or black people
Amma spoke about going to her first black women’s group in Brixton in
her last year at school, she’d seen a flyer at her local library
the woman who opened the door, Elaine, sported a perfect halo of an
afro and her smooth limbs were clad tightly in light blue denim jeans and
tight denim shirt
Amma wanted her on sight, followed her into the main room where
women sat on sofas, chairs, cushions, cross-legged on the floor, drinking
cups of coffee and cider
she nervously accepted cigarettes as they were passed around, sat on the
floor leaning against a cat-mauled tweedy armchair, feeling Elaine’s warm
leg against her arm
she listened as they debated what it meant to be a black woman
what it meant to be a feminist when white feminist organizations made
them feel unwelcome
how it felt when people called them nigger, or racist thugs beat them up
what it was like when white men opened doors or gave up their seats on
public transport for white women (which was sexist), but not for them
(which was racist)
Amma could relate to their experiences, began to join in with the
refrains of, we hear you, sister, we’ve all been there, sister
it felt like she was coming in from the cold
at the end of her first evening, the other women said their goodbyes and
Amma offered to stay behind to wash up the cups and ashtrays with Elaine

they made out on one of the bumpy sofas in the glow of the streetlight
to the accompaniment of police sirens haring by
it was the closest she’d come to making love to herself
it was another coming home
the next week when she went to the meeting
Elaine was canoodling with another woman
and blanked her completely
she never went again
Amma and Dominique stayed until they were turfed out, had worked
their way through numerous glasses of red wine
they decided they needed to start their own theatre company to have
careers as actors, because neither was prepared to betray their politics to
find jobs
or shut their mouths to keep them
it seemed the obvious way forward
they scribbled ideas for names on hard toilet paper snaffled from the loo
Bush Women Theatre Company best captured their intentions
they would be a voice in theatre where there was silence
black and Asian women’s stories would get out there
they would create theatre on their own terms
it became the company’s motto
On Our Own Terms
or Not At All. 2
Living rooms became rehearsal spaces, old bangers transported props,
costumes came from second-hand shops, sets were extracted from junk
yards, they called on mates to help out, everyone learning on the job, ad
hoc, throwing their lot in together
they wrote grant applications on old typewriters with missing keys,
budgets felt as alien to Amma as quantum physics, she balked at becoming
trapped behind a desk
she upset Dominique when she arrived for admin sessions late and left
early claiming headaches or PMT

they rowed when she walked into a stationery shop and ran straight out
again claiming it had brought on a panic attack
she had a go at Dominique when she didn’t deliver the script she’d
promised to write but was out late night clubbing instead, or forgot her lines
mid-show
six months after its inception, they were constantly at loggerheads
they’d hit it off as friends, only to find they couldn’t work together
Amma called a make-or-break meeting at hers
they sat down with wine and a Chinese takeaway and Dominique
admitted she got more pleasure setting up tours for the company than
putting herself in front of an audience, and preferred being herself to
pretending to be other people
Amma admitted she loved writing, hated admin and was she really any
good as an actor? she did anger brilliantly – which was the extent of her
range
Dominique became the company manager, Amma the artistic director
they employed actresses, directors, designers, stage crews, set up
national tours that lasted months
their plays, The Importance of Being Female, FGM: The Musical, Disarranged Marriage, Cunning Stunts, were performed in community centres,
libraries, fringe theatres, at women’s festivals and conferences
they leafleted outside venues as audiences left and arrived, illegally
plastered posters on to billboards in the dead of night
they started getting reviews in the alternative media, and even produced
a monthly Bush Women samizdat
but due to pathetically poor sales and, to be honest, pathetically poor
writing, it lasted for two issues after its grand launch one summer’s evening
at Sisterwrite
where a group of women rolled up to enjoy the free plonk and spill out
on to the pavement to light up and chat each other up
Amma supplemented her income working in a burger bar at Piccadilly
Circus
where she sold hamburgers made of reconstituted cardboard topped
with rehydrated onions and rubbery cheese
all of which she also ate for free in her breaks – which gave her spots
the orange nylon suit and hat she wore meant customers saw her as a
uniformed servant to do their bidding

and not her wonderful, artistic, highly individualistic and rebellious self
she slipped free crusty pies filled with apple-flavoured lumps of sugar to
the runaway rent boys she befriended who operated around the station
with no idea that in years to come she’d be attending their funerals
they didn’t realize unprotected sex meant a dance with death
nobody did
home was a derelict factory in Deptford with concrete walls, a
collapsing ceiling and a community of rats that defeated all attempts at
extermination
thereafter she moved into a series of similarly squalid squats until she
found herself living in the most desirable squat in the whole of London, a
Soviet-sized former office block at the back of King’s Cross
she was lucky enough to be one of the first to hear of it before it filled
up
and stayed upstairs when bailiffs set a hydraulic excavator at the main
door
which triggered violent countermeasures and prison sentences for the
head-bangers who thought a bailiff down deserved a good kicking
they called it the Battle of King’s Cross
the building was thereafter known as the Republic of Freedomia
they were lucky, too, because the owner of the property, a certain Jack
Staniforth, living tax-free in Monte Carlo, loaded from the profits of his
family’s business in Sheffield cutlery, turned out to be sympathetic to their
cause once news reached him from his estate holding company
he’d fought for the International Brigade in the Spanish Civil War
and a bad-investment of a building in one of London’s seediest districts
was a forgettable footnote to his accounts
if they looked after the place, he wrote
they could stay for free
they stopped the illegal tapping of electricity and opened an account
with the London Electricity Board
likewise with the gas, hitherto powered by a single fifty pence piece
jammed into a meter
they needed to set up a management system and gathered one Saturday
morning in the lobby to thrash it out
the Marxists demanded they set up a Central Committee of the Workers’
Republic of Freedomia, which was a bit rich, Amma thought, seeing as

most of them had taken ‘a principled stand against the running dogs of
capitalism’ as an excuse to not work
the hippies suggested they form a commune and share everything, but
they were so chilled and laid back, everybody talked over them
the environmentalists wanted to ban aerosols, plastic bags and
deodorant, which turned everyone against them, even the punks who
weren’t exactly known for smelling minty
the vegetarians demanded a non-meat policy, the vegans wanted it
extended to non-dairy, the macrobiotics suggested everyone eat steamed
white cabbage for breakfast
the Rastas wanted cannabis legalized, and a reserved plot on the land
out back for their Nyabinghi gatherings
the Hari Krishnas wanted everyone to join them that very afternoon
banging drums down Oxford Street
the punks wanted permission to play shouty music and were duly
shouted down
the gay guys wanted anti-homophobic legislation enshrined into the
building’s constitution, to which everyone replied, what constitution? the radical feminists wanted women-only quarters, self-governed by a
co-op
the lesbian radical feminists wanted their own quarters away from the
non-lesbian radical feminists, also self-governed by a co-op
the black radical lesbian feminists wanted the same except with the
condition that no whiteys of any gender were allowed inside
the anarchists walked out because any form of governance was a
betrayal of everything they believed in
Amma preferred running solo, and mixing with others who didn’t try to
impose their will on anyone else
in the end a straightforward rotating management committee was
formed with various rules against drug-dealing, sexual harassment and
voting Tory
the plot out back became a communal space featuring scrap metal
sculptures
courtesy of the artists
Amma managed to lay claim to a typing pool so large she could jog
around it

with its own private toilet and sink that she kept blissfully clean and
suffused with floral scents
she coated the walls and ceiling with a striking blood-red paint, ripped
up the corporate-grey carpet, threw a few raffia mats on the wooden floor,
installed a second-hand cooker, fridge, bean bags, a futon, and a bath
reclaimed from a junk yard
her room was big enough for parties and big enough for people to crash
the disco beats of Donna Summer, Sister Sledge, Minnie Riperton and
Chaka Khan swirling on vinyl got her parties going
Roberta, Sarah, Edith, Etta and Mathilde Santing were the soundtracks
to her end of night seductions
behind the eighteenth-century black lacquer Chinese screen, rescued
from a skip outside the old Chinese Embassy
she worked her way through many of the women of Freedomia
she wanted one-night stands, most wanted more than that
it got to the point where she dreaded passing her former conquests in the
corridors, like Maryse, a translator from Guadeloupe
if she wasn’t knocking on Amma’s door in the middle of the night
begging to be let in, she was lurking outside it to harass whoever was
getting what she wanted
this progressed to name-calling from her window whenever she saw
Amma approach the building, all of it coming to a head when she tipped a
bucket of vegetable peel over Amma one day as she passed beneath her
window
infuriating both the environmentalists and the management committee
who took it upon themselves to write to Amma that she ‘stop shitting on her
own doorstep’
Amma wrote back how it was interesting that quickly people turned into
totalitarian fascists once they’d been given a little power
but she’d learned her lesson and wasn’t short of attention; groupies
queued up for Amma and Dominique as the main players of Bush Women
Theatre
everyone from baby dykes in their late teens to women who could be
their mothers
Amma didn’t discriminate, she bragged to her friends that her tastes
were truly egalitarian as they traversed culture, class, creed, race, religion
and generation

which, happily, gave her a bigger playing field than most
(she kept her predilection for big tits quiet because it was un-feminist to
isolate body parts for sexual objectification)
Dominique was more selective and monogamous, serially so, she went
for actresses, usually blonde, whose microscopic talent was overshadowed
by their macroscopic beauty
or models whose looks were their talent
women-only bars were their hangouts
Fallen Angel, Rackets, the Bell, the Drill Hall Theatre bar on a Monday
where the lesbianarati hung out, and Pearl’s shebeen in Brixton on a Friday
night run by Pearl, a middle-aged Jamaican woman who stripped her
basement of furniture, set up a sound system and charged at the door
Amma experienced commitment to one person as imprisonment, she
hadn’t left home for a life of freedom and adventure to end up chained to
another person’s desires
if she slept with a woman more than two or three times, they usually
went from attractively independent to increasingly needy
within the space of a week
she’d become their sole source of happiness as they moved to assert
their authority over her autonomy, by any means necessary
sulks, tears, accusations of selfishness and heartlessness
Amma learnt to head all women off, to state her intentions upfront, to
never sleep with the same person twice, or pushing it, thrice
even when she wanted to
sex was a simple, harmless, human pleasure and until her late thirties
she got a lot of it
how many were there? one hundred, another fifty? surely not more than
that? a couple of friends suggested she try therapy to help her settle down,
she replied she was practically a virgin compared to male rock stars who
boasted conquests of thousands and were admired for it

a knock at the door and the Commander appeared. He crossed his arms across
his chest. I crossed my arms across my chest. I looked up and glared then looked away. I wanted to be alone. “You don’t look happy to see me.”
I looked down at my bare legs, tried to pull the thin towel around me and
down my legs a little more. “You shouldn’t sound so disappointed, Commander. I might start to think you’re getting ideas about me.”

silky as she’d always expected. “Fuck, you are beautiful, Red.” Edwin peppered kisses over
her breasts, leaving the cloth of the costume in place. It was a
touch, but not enough. It was sinful torture. “More.” Her hands glided over his shoulders, feeling the heat

exhaustion. The way I’m seated, my clit rubs against the coarse hairs at his base and it’s fucking debilitating. He’s licking the noises I make right out of my mouth and
swallowing them whole, hammering into me harder just to force me to cry out to him. One second I’m flying, the next I’m crashing. He’s hitting that spot so perfectly.",Forget_Me_Not_8_26

the other and began to whistle. You’ll probably think I’m horrible, Beverly
said, but I think I want to kiss you. Her lips parted slightly. Ben’s own lips were suddenly too dry to whistle. “I think I want you to,” he whispered, and smiled a dopey, dizzy, and
absolutely beautiful grin. If he had looked down at the sidewalk just then, he would have seen that
three other shadows had grown around his own; if he had been listening he
would have heard the sound of Victor’s cleats as he, Belch, and Henry
closed in. But he neither heard nor saw. Ben was far away, feeling Beverly’s
lips slip softly against his mouth, raising his timid hands to touch the dim
Irish fire of her hair. 9

He snorts. “It’d be like fucking you in a church.”
I shrug, using my longest finger to hook the top of a novel and pull it from its perch, letting it crash to the floor between us. “Oops,” I squeak. Silas’s tongue darts out on his bottom lip. I bend at the waist, matching his gaze on the way down and letting the scoop of my collar hang dangerously low across my breasts. I don’t miss it when he

You. All she’d ever wanted was Zain. “Your mouth.”

“You tell me.” He drew my attention back to his hypnotizing stare, and I fought the helpless feeling I had to kiss him as he crowded me against the
cold metal. “It’s your dream, Birdie.” We shared a few seconds of pregnant silence, watching each other’s lips part. He weaved his hand through my
hair, and when I didn’t move away he took it in stride—pressing his mouth to mine until he felt me melt into it. Without pulling away he asked, “Does
this make you the bad guy?”
“Silas,” I mumbled as I averted my eyes, but the syllables came out breathless. He waited for me to finish the thought, and when met with silence he
continued on, slipping his tongue through my lips to tangle with mine. “You have to tell Logan,” he whispered against my mouth, kissing down the column of my throat as his knee pressed into the space between my legs. I let out a quiet laugh that towed the line between condescension and desperation. “Tell him what? Hm?”

frowned. “Jesus, Fran, you’re really bleeding.” He pulled a handkerchief out of his
back pocket and looked at it doubtfully. Then he put it back. The image of the two of them walking hand in hand back to the parking
lot came to her, young lovers under a summer sun, her with his
handkerchief stuffed in her mouth. She raises her hand to the smiling,

this stops.”
There’s no time for me to protest or inquire about his
well-being because he’s rubbing back into me. The entirety
of his face is hidden between me, chin-and-nose settled
deep in my sopping wetness, tongue slithering out, his jaw
moving animatedly, doing everything in his power to break
me. He sucks the fucking soul of me, moaning every time I
undulate above him, directing his movements in a certain
way. He moves back to give himself space to trace the
moist slit of me, fluttering the pads of his hot fingers
against the slick, sensitive skin until he finds my entrance. When he pushes a finger inside, I offer no resistance, my
body opening willingly to the intrusion. He adds a second finger and fucks me feverishly,
wiggling the tip of his tongue against my clit as he pistons
his digits in and out, then adds another finger. “That’s it. Pull me in,” he encourages, his baritone raspy. He scatters

her tighter against me, never wanting to let go. I’m forced to, though, when she pushes away from me. “Move your chair and take your boxers off,” she commands,
leaning over the kitchen table we’d been studying on to
grab her discarded hair tie. Immediately, I know exactly how Greta is going to thank
me. She collects her hair into a tight ponytail, shoving off

rub against mine, tracing salacious promises before
retreating. He drags the tip of his nose down my neck to
the valley between my breasts, tending to them in devotion. It’s while he’s sucking on my nipple that he brings his
hand between my legs and touches my slick cunt. The
contact is unexpected but no less wonderful, his touch
certain. “Oh, fuck,” I choke out, rearing up. “Yes, please.”
I feel his laughter more than I hear it, the amusement
jostling both our bodies. He slides two skilled fingers along
the seam of my pussy, collecting the moisture that pools
there. My back arches off the bed, excitement furling at the
pit of my stomach. My neglected clit throbs, and just when
I think he’s about to touch it, he withdraws. I could crush this sniveling little shit to pulp between my
knees.",Midnight_Kisses_2_4

free of her arms. When her hands left the headboard, more out of
habit than fear, he didn’t say a word as he took her wrists once
more and placed them back against the headboard. Another shaky breath. Another hint of fear. Both vanished
when he took a nipple in his mouth, sucking it through the lace of
her bra. The material gave his mouth a rougher edge but she
needed more. She needed to feel the slickness of his tongue
without a barrier. “Tate,” she whimpered.",Ivy_21_27

one side of his mouth. “Girl, you are hurt.”
“Vera is having people attacked. You know that. Remember Julian. We
have to stop her.”
His good hand stroked his face as if he were tracing the edge of the
good part and bad part. “We expected paradise. To find paradise. Do you

Heat spread across her cheeks. Oh. My. God. “Sorry.”
“Don’t be. I don’t know what a first kiss smells like but I’m
taking it as a compliment.”
A first kiss smelled like a man. Like clean soap with spicy
undertones. Like temptation and anticipation. When Cassia closed
her eyes, when she thought of the scent she wanted to inhale
before a man’s lips touched hers, it was Edwin’s. As she sank into her pillows, he retrieved the tray and brought
it to her lap. There was a warm blueberry muffin on a small plate

desperately hungry for pleasure. And I pressed my face into her
sweet, hungry little sex, rather eager to pleasure her. But as my
tongue delved into her swollen cleft, as I licked her little clitoris,
and her swollen lips, I was walloped by the belt continuously. My
ﬂaxen-haired one chose one welt after another for her work, and I
was in great pain as the bound Princess ﬁnally shuddered with
pleasure in spite of herself. ""Of course, there were others who had been punished enough

fallen off, so he lifted it away. “Nervous?”
“No.” She shook her head, hoping he could hear the truth in
her voice. “Not even a bit.”
“Good.” A smile tugged at his lips and he flashed her a dimple. She leaned forward, doing another thing she’d wanted to do
for months. She licked that dimple. Then she licked his Adam’s

the parking lot. Two rows away, directly past the Bentley, a man in a suit had
the slutty nurse she’d seen in the lounge bent over the hood of his
orange Corvette. His hands gripped her hips as he thrust into her
with slapping strokes. He reached for the top of her costume and
yanked it away from her breast, the sound of material ripping
joining their moans as he pinched her nipple. “Yes,” the woman hissed, pressing her cheek against the car. Her eyes landed on Cassia and a smile spread across her mouth. Cassia froze, unable to move but unable to look away.",Ivy_13_31

was cast in muted light as she propped herself up against her
headboard. Then she set the phone against a pillow to her side,
making sure it would capture her profile at just the right angle. The screen showed her face. It showed her torso. It showed
the sliver of skin she exposed on her stomach when she pushed
the bedding down her lap and slipped her hand inside the
waistband of her pajama pants. The recording wasn’t long. All Ivy had to do was think of Tate’s
tongue in her mouth and she was on the edge of an orgasm. Her

slumped to the side, my head ringing. I didn’t stop singing though my words
slowed, slurred. I was supposed to be at the beach with my husband. I was supposed to wrap
my legs around Michael’s waist as he carried me into the ocean and away from
the shore while our son napped. I would trace his jaw with my fingertips and my
lips. I would taste the salt and sun and sea on his skin and he would hold me so
tight it hurt to breathe. We would ignore everything around us and he would kiss
me like he always kisses me—hard, with purpose, the soft of our lip flesh
bruising, pulpy, his tongue in my mouth, a hand twisting through my hair
possessively. He always tries so hard to hold on to me because he does not
realize I am with him always. We are a lock and key. We are nothing without

house that we bump into Greta. “Greta!” I scream, the suddenness and volume of my
exclamation causing both girls to jump. “Otis.” She looks me up and down, thoroughly
inspecting my outfit. If I were a peacock, I’d be cocking the
fuck up right now, my feathers bright and wide. I inspect her, too, starting at her face and end at her
boobs, which are pushed so high up her chest, they could
substitute for the loose lace scarf she’s hung around her
neck, covering her mouth-watering collarbone. “Greta,” I repeat because my brain has short-circuited. The necklace she has on is draped low, stopping just above
where the mounds of her breasts press together, and all I
can think about is whether or not it would stay in place if I
were to fuck her, her sweat working as an adhesive. “Oats,” Katia says. “Aren’t you going to introduce us?”
My sister looks between Greta and me, appearing
scrupulous then triumphant as the gears in her head click
into place. Whatever notion she might have had of me
being hung up on Autumn are eradicated, the drool
dribbling out the corner of my mouth from all the tit-ogling
a clear indication.",Midnight_Kisses_16_44

possession, which she readily cedes, intoxicating me
further. I’m drunk on the liqueur de Miriam, and if I have it
my way, I won’t be sobering up soon. Grabbing the ends of my hoodie strings, she stands on
her tiptoes to press firmly against me, her back arched to
eliminate any gaps. Taking my upper lip between her teeth,
she tugs. I make a sound, somewhere between an objection
and a hum of desire. She apologizes with gentle flicks of
her tongue, coaxing my mouth open so she can conduct a
study on the structure of my mouth. I’m only too eager to
assist her in the task. Her rack isn’t one to inspire devote
R&B songs, but she could definitely get an indie band to
slip a lone or two about them in theirs. Still holding onto the fork, I use my free hand to trace
her body. I dip my fingers through her robe and under her

breast, her nipples growing hard.",Midnight_Kisses_4_21

primitive and wonderful to watch her commitment to my

Fuck, fuck, fuck. She cups and tickles my balls then teases the puckered
opening of my ass with a finger. One more twist of her wrist
and a tight, pointed suck and flick at the tip, and I’m letting
go, thick ropes of cum jetting from my cock and into her
throat. “Miriam,” I shout, the name slipping from my lips like a
rueful prayer, my face contorted in unadulterated desire. She says something, too, except her words are muffled, a
mixture of our saliva and cum leaking from the corner of
her mouth. It’s one of the most intense orgasms I’ve ever
experienced. The volcano that is my orgasm erupts, and the
lava beneath my skin saturates me in an intense heat, its
flames shooting through my veins. A rush of adrenaline hits
me, and my hips stutter out of beat as she sucks me dry,
greedy for every last drop. Wave after wave of euphoria swirls through me. I’m
soaring high in the sky, and somehow, I’m allowed access
into heaven.",Midnight_Kisses_12_20

lips and jaws aching as I tried to suck it properly. The Queen gave
me instructions, to make my strokes long, to use my tongue, and to
go faster and faster. She spanked me unmercifully as I obeyed, her
smacking blows in perfect rhythm with my sucking. At last his seed
ﬁlled my mouth. I was commanded to swallow it. ""But the Queen was not at all pleased with my reticence. She
said that I must show no disinclination towards anything.""

walked over to him and got on my knees. I would fight by giving him that which he did not yet want. I feigned
surrender. I held his wrist gently, pressed my lips against the underside. I
became someone different, a woman who could satisfy a man with his desires. I
held his wrist and opened my mouth and swallowed the barrel of his gun,
occasionally massaging his arm. The gun was hard. My teeth scraping the metal

shaft pulsed as she rocked against him, letting it fit into her slit
and coating it with her wetness. They kissed, rough and wild, until
the coil in her center twisted tight, demanding more. She reached between them, taking him in her grip and fitting
him to her entrance. Then she rose up on her knees and took him

over the leaking tip, smug when he grabs the wall beside
us. His other hand digs into my thigh, his fingers imparting
deep craters there. A blush stains the skin of his chest,
neck, and face. It’s adorable, especially given how close he
is, the steady drips of pre-cum smearing my hands
signaling his imminent release. “I wanna fuck you in the
bedroom. Please.”
But I’m not paying attention to him, and to be frank, I
don’t care. My mouth waters, the urge to fill it with his
thick cock too strong to resist any longer. “Here.”

raw. He would be hated now. No one would remember his glory, or his

his brow. The part in his lips. The tension in his jaw. Perfection. He

I gape at him. He blinks back innocently, and I try to
keep calm as I carefully respond, “Did you really stop
kissing me to say that?”
He licks his puffy lips nervously and opens his mouth to
explain, only to close it again. “Sorry,” he hums warily,
looking away as he scratches his head. “It’s my favorite
board game.”
My heart hiccups at the silly grin he offers with his
apology and the timid way he avoids eye contact. To make
this all the more heart-throbbing, he adjusts his glasses and

gives a helpless shrug, effectively shattering any flicker of
annoyance I might have had before. A cozy billow of warmth sweeps through me, making the
distance he’s put between us unbearable. I immediately

closer. I traced his lips with my fingers, so soft. Michael slowly opened his eyes and was about to say something but I said,
“Shhh.” He slid one of his hands through my hair and kissed me with an
uncommon urgency. He kissed me like he was trying to swallow me whole and I
gave in to it, to him, his breath in my throat. I was feverish. He pushed me onto
my back and dragged his fingers across my collarbones, touched me so softly. I

tip, and he lets out a grated fuck, when I use it to pump him messily. I give him my big blue eyes, my little palm wrapped around him, mouth lapping and sucking at the head. It’s almost too much to bear when I dip back down,
deep enough to sputter and choke as my throat contracts around him again. He can’t take it. “Ride me,” he begs. So I do. I hook my legs over his hips and settle down on top of him, eyes fluttering shut as we moan together at the first stretch of my cunt over his cock.",Forget_Me_Not_8_25

inside, past her teeth. She licked the pad, then wrapped her
mouth around it and sucked. Zain pulsed inside her, his eyes flaring with heat. His thumb
popped free from her mouth and dropped to her clit. The moment

corner of his mouth turned up too as he started the ignition. As he
headed down the lane toward the gate, he took Ivy’s hand, lacing
their fingers together and lifting her knuckles to his lips. She’d seen that sort of kiss in movies. Watched couples on

Zain teaching her little techniques because she was a hopeless
chef. They’d relaxed on the beach, reading books and talking

my legs, and there was nothing I could do, nothing that felt more natural
and right, than to touch her in the same place, with my fingers that had just
kissed her mouth. And we rocked together, touching and not kissing, her
face buried against my shoulder so that I could feel the damp heat of her
breath on my collarbone, until we made for each other that miracle that in
my homeland is called the little death. I slept then, in her arms, for a few short hours—a sleep more peaceful
than I’d ever hoped to find before I rejoin my mother’s bones in the Paris
earth. How can I describe my life in the sweet rush of that time? I spent nearly
every night with Nan, coming home to her arms and her bed—and they felt
like home too—after terrorizing the fine gentlemen of London and
sometimes further abroad. Terrorizing them just enough to make them
doubt their own entitlement to ruin any girl they pleased without
consequence. I fell in love with my own power as I fell in love with Nan. I stopped

Silas can feel the sweat beading on his forehead and as it trickles down the planes of his back. I am a fucking vision, splayed across his sheets like this. Ass

filled the air, mingling with his heady scent. The sound of slapping
skin mixed with the sound of panted breaths as they rocked

kept kissing her, and then she felt him touching her, and for a minute she thought
she felt an old familiar feeling of terror, but when she opened her eyes again, she
knew she had been dreaming. Marcus was standing there, looking down at her,
and smiling at her. Her mouth felt dry, and she felt strangely nauseous. ""What's happening?"" She felt frightened and sick, and there were spots in front
of her eyes now, and he was just standing there, laughing. ""I think the wine got the best of you.""
""I'm really sorry."" She was mortified, but then he knelt down next to her and
kissed her so hard it made her dizzy again. But she liked it. There was a heady feeling to what was happening, she wanted it to stop, and yet
she didn't. ""I'm not sorry at all,"" he whispered from between her breasts.",malice_13_6

pushed the hair out of her face, then flew into the bathroom for a
hair tie. By the time she’d returned to the room, Edwin was sitting
on the edge of the bed, his bare legs kicked over the side. “Cassia—”
She held up a hand. “I think you should go.”
“Kicking me out already?” He huffed. “Got what you needed
from me this morning?”
She crossed her arms over her chest. “Like you didn’t get the
same.”
Edwin stood and stalked her way, his naked body a lethal
weapon. It was impossible not to notice the way his cock swung
between his legs. “That’s it?",Ivy_14_5

saw me?”
“Mmmm,” he hums, mouth still latched onto my chest. The vibration fucking unravels me. I feel the lash of his tongue pulling at nerves I didn’t know possible. In
my mouth, in the pit of my stomach, in the dips and folds of my pussy where they haven’t already been sparked to life. “I know when there’s a hen in a fox den,”
he mouths, working his way up the center of me, back to my neck, to my lips. I nestle my hand between our bodies and touch him again, running a thumb over the weeping head where it’s waiting patiently at the cusp of my legs. “So what
are you waiting for?” I ask as I notch the thick tip of him between the wet, wanting lips of my cunt, sliding it over my clit. “Devour me.”
Silas smiles as he thrusts inside, catching the noises that leave my throat in his mouth. The soft groans reach a higher pitch as he stretches me completely and
rocks his hips hard enough to hit the deepest part of my core in one swift stroke.",Forget_Me_Not_8_59

gorgeous cock inside me instead, fucking me the way you
did in that video.” She moans softly, her breaths wet and
heavy. “You know how much I love it when you’re rough
with me, and especially when you come inside me.” There’s
a pause and a whimper. I’m just about ready to die, my ears on fire, my nose
runny. “You’ve seen the video I’m talking about, right? Seen
how much of a whore you turn me into when you fuck me.”
I run my hand through my hair and tug at the ends,
fearing I might go insane. Since recording it, I’ve only had
the opportunity to luxuriate in our porno skills once, and I
can recall the amateur footage hazily at best. I hate myself
for not putting it on repeat. “Jesus, G. You’re such a fucking

“Who’s this guy Denbrough?”
“Forget it. I was—”
She realized almost too late that the question had been a distraction. He
was coming for her before the last word was out of his mouth. She
whickered the belt through the air in an arc and the sound it made when it
smashed across his mouth was the sound of a stubborn cork coming out of a
bottle. He squealed and clapped his hands to his mouth, his eyes huge, hurt and
shocked. Blood began to pour between his fingers and over the backs of his
hands. “You broke my mouth, you bitch!” he screamed, muffled. “Ah God you
broke my mouth!”

head of poor Lou-Lou. To my surprise, he opened a watery brown eye and
looked at me. I bent and listened to his breathing. The rasp in it had
lessened. I looked in his mouth. His tongue was swollen and his muzzle dry. I fetched water from my washstand and spooned a little into his mouth. He
lapped it with all the eagerness a sick Spaniel can muster. It is as if, I said to
myself, the purging and vomiting he's been forced to endure has drained his
body of its vital moisture.",Restoration_Rose_Tremain_1_28

her face when she came against my mouth, and my dick

having her again. Wait, she’s too sore. That’s what she’d said last night. The admission had been both a blessing and a curse—a
blessing for my pride and a curse for my sex drive, which is
howling for more after an abstinence spell. “Damn,” is all she says. I clear my throat and fix the uneven lengths of my
hoodie strings. “Yeah. Sorry about that.” To keep from
pawing her again, I busy myself with putting the finished
slice on a plate and preparing the other one. “Just wanted
to kiss you good morning.”
“It’s all good. No need to apologize.",Midnight_Kisses_4_23

spray. Then he cupped the back of her neck with his good hand,
hauling her close to seal his mouth over hers. The stroke of his tongue was slow and languid. The slide of
her hands over the rounded curve of his ass was lazy and
deliberate. They devoured each other, licking and sucking, until
her lips were swollen and the water had turned lukewarm. Elora helped him with the towel and into a pair of boxers, then
as he brushed his teeth, she did the same. Once he was in bed,
she traded her own towel for one of his T-shirts, then climbed in
beside him, curling into his right side. His good side. Her phone dinged in the kitchen with a text, probably from
Francis or maybe Ivy. But she didn’t make a move to leave, laying
a hand over Zain’s heart.",Ivy_20_11

stares at me with so much hunger that I’m actually a little
concerned for my well-being. “How badly do you want my
mouth on you?” Kissing around my knees, her hands
massage up and down the side of my thigh, drawing
ellipses along its span, getting just close enough to my dick
that I can sense the touch but not so close that I can feel it. Evil, sexy woman. “I’ll give you anything. Whatever the fuck you want, I’ll
—” My words falter and become lost, my breath hitching in
surprise. She lifts my dick to run her tongue down the
length, her lips grazing the sensitive skin of my balls, her
nose pressed against the base. The grin she wears is

There’s no chance for me to fully comprehend what he’s
said, to preen with pride from my accomplishment, when
he starts to properly thrust in me, offering a languid but
harsh rhythm that builds. The sudden movement ricochets
me up the bed, and my head beats against the headboard. There’s complete ease in the way he slips inside me, and
every time he bottoms out, he takes a second and remains
sheathed for a while longer, his hips circling to brush and
bump against every inch of me as my nipples scrape their
own little pattern against his chest. Again and again, he
does this, expelling whatever ability I have to breathe each
time he glides out and dives back in. Dipping his head, he tends to my breasts, brushing his
wet lips over them and capturing a nipple when he fucks
into me just right and they jiggle into his receptive mouth. He draws amorous messages on them with the tip of his
tongue and scrapes his teeth over the soft skin when I
abandon my plans on his back to grip his ass, urging him to
sink in deeper, as if he’s not already bumping the hidden
recess that reveals all the pleasures the universe can offer. But then we get close. Really close. The beat of his cock
synchronizes with the pulsing of my snatch, and he’s
dripping inside me, out of me, leaking down my ass and
onto the bed. And it’s at this cusp that the dynamic
between us shifts and the playful dominance he’s asserted
turns possessive and urgent, touching where we’re joined.",Midnight_Kisses_36_14

I lean over and pinch his lips together with two fingers, as if that’ll keep him quiet, trying not to giggle at the pout he gives me. Instead, he pulls me over his hips with little effort, and I squeak at the abrupt change of positioning. “I can think of a divine way for you to shut me up, Birdie,” Silas teases, squeezing my ass until I shuffle up his body and am seated more so on his
chest. “But you know I love talking.”
I shuffle even closer, hovering over his face with my knees on either side of his head. Silas looks up through long eyelashes like this is a punishment
he’s more than willing to take, jutting his tongue out to lick his lips as he savors the view. “No more talk-”
His tongue is on me before I can even get the last word out. Silas doesn’t need to sleep tonight to go there with me.

wheezes in agony when I’m not even halfway down his
length. Still, his head slants back in a haze of pleasure. “I’m being meticulous,” I mew mockingly. I accidentally
shift, his cock nestling in deeper at this new, delicious
angle. It’s easier to take him this way, my pussy distending

she’d try. “What are your thoughts on ass play?”

her senses and she moaned as he tangled his tongue with hers. Tate’s arms banded around her, hauling her to his body so hard it
was like touching granite. He put her exactly where he wanted
her, just like their first dance. The heat from his chest seeped through her pajamas and
pebbled her nipples, sending a new rush of need to her core. Then he slanted his lips over hers to plunder every corner of her
mouth. Ivy had let men kiss her. She’d allowed it. But this? Tate claimed her. She was entirely out of control, and for once,

I pressed myself against him, his thighs to my thighs, our hipbones pressed
together. I loved his body, how much bigger he was, but in that moment, I hated
his body and how he could drown me. I kissed his neck, pulled at the skin softly
with my teeth. He moaned softly, found my lips again. I tried to relax, tried to
ignore the panic, the way my skin ached. I ran my fingers through his hair and
rolled onto my back, pulling him on top of me. He was so heavy; he was
pressing me through the mattress. Michael slid his hands beneath my tank top,
pressing his fingertips against my ribs.",An_Untamed_State_20_16

I breathed a sigh of relief and slid closer to him, rested my cheek against his
chest. He sleepily rubbed my back in slow circles the way he usually does when

stretch. Fuck, I just want him to take what’s his. I writhe and he groans in my ear, pressing his heavy palm against the skin between my belly and my core and holding me—splaying his fingers out and keeping
me from moving underneath them. “Don’t move, Eliza,” he grunts. “I can’t control myself.”
“Silas...” I drop my head back against the damp skin of his shoulder and he peppers feather light kisses to my cheek and the corner of my mouth. “Silas

that the hunger clouding his features isn’t at all

him when he kissed her breasts. Bjurman came round the desk to show her the statement of her bank account—which she knew down to the last öre,
although it was no longer at her disposal. He stood behind her. Suddenly he was massaging the back of her neck, and

brought my legs over his shoulders, his head clamped

each cautious bump against my clit is rewarded with an
involuntary squeeze of my knees. It’s when he incorporates
his fingers, maneuvering his hands around my body to

muted pleasure as molten heat licks up my body starting

life had Ivy seen a more beautiful man. “Ivy.” Tate’s voice sounded pained. “Don’t look at me like that if
you don’t want me to kiss you.”

“That’s ridiculous.” He growled. “Don’t ever ask me that again.”
I slid toward him. A thousand tiny hooks pulled at my skin. I clasped the back
of his neck and pulled his mouth to mine. I kissed him softly, so softly. I took in
his breath, traced his lips with my finger, tried to memorize their softness, their
shape. I kissed him again, harder. I thought, “This man is my husband,” and
repeated those words silently so I would not forget, so I could love the man I
was with despite the men who were with me. He responded shyly, kept his hands

I groaned while I chewed, the bar itself was stale and chalky, but it tasted like
a five star meal anyway. Silas tore the wrapper open with his teeth and traded me bite for bite until the stash withered to null. You cleaned house, Birdie, he had said, and I swatted his

He kisses me again and grumbles, reluctantly slumping away. “Remember, discrete.” I point at him as I back up against the hatch door. Silas leaps toward me a final time, pressing me against the metal, framing my face with his palms and dipping to close his lips over mine. I lick into him first,

skims between the valley of my breast until he’s reached
the wing of my shoulders, my voice cracking in

was close before, there’s no way to describe the proximity

He chuckles and tilts his neck back, offering me better

before digging my teeth in, tugging, sucking, and kissing
until he directs my ministrations back to his mouth. A sigh
escapes me, bleeding into the kiss. He absorbs this
contented sound while I strive to drink him in, licking my
way inside, sliding my tongue languidly against his. I hold
him captive, intoxicated by the way he relinquishes control,
giving me free rein to plunder his mouth as roughly or
gently as I want. All the while, he’s attentive to me. His
hands snake under my shirt, skimming my torso, up my
waist, until settling below my breasts, the pads of his

those very pretty lips would look stretched around a flesh
that’s thicker and longer. Thoughts about the flutter of
those pretty lashes, her pretty eyes on me, the sound of her
pretty moans vibrating around my cock when I hit the back
of her pretty throat. Pretty, pretty, pretty. God, I would love to fuck the pretty

before, I’m in no mood for small talk, and flirting is all

her fist palming in tandem with her mouth. I jolt forward

I suck in a breath when he bites my calf, then licks it better on instinct and continues his travels, hoisting my knee up to rest on his shoulder. “I told you I was going to take my time with you,” he murmurs, kissing the crease where my thigh meets the back of my knee. “I am many things of a moral

shower, and even the cool mix of the tiles as I’m rutted up against the wall. It all makes my eyes roll back. Silas feels me clench around him, a hot rush of slick coating deep thrust after deep thrust, and he loses it too—squeezing one of my breasts with his free hand to
keep himself planted. I bray at the pain but he hushes me—his palm over my mouth again, still hammering his hips up into mine just as rawly. “If you keep chirping like that, everyone will know you’re here, little bird,” he whispers.

heart which she did not fully understand. Yet she was afraid as

""Kiss me as you desire to kiss me.""
And overjoyed she kissed the cold smoothness of his forehead,
kissed the dark locks of his hair, his eyelids and his long eyelashes. She kissed his cheeks, and then his open mouth. And his tongue

meaning to, she reached out to clasp his hips with her hands. The Prince kicked Prince Alexi's legs wide apart and taking
Beauty's head roughly in his left hand so that he might kiss her, he
drove his organ into Prince Alexi's anus. Prince Alexi moaned at the roughness and swiftness of the thrusts. Beauty felt the pressure against her as Prince Alexi was driven ever
more quickly by it. The Prince had let her go, and she was crying. She
held tight to Prince Alexi, and then the Prince gave his ﬁnal thrust
with a moan, his hands pressed to Prince Alexi's back, and he stood
still letting his pleasure course through him. Beauty tried to keep herself quiet. Prince Alexi let her go, but not without a secret little kiss between

I kiss him hard again, grinding my middle into the soft material of his shorts where he holds me straddled against the wall. I feel him twitch underneath them. “Wouldn’t dream of it,” I breathe.

time, teasing his tongue into the opening of my pussy with
a few shallow thrusts, a precursor to what he’ll to do with
his cock later. My hips twist in delight at the cresting ache
expanding inside me as his tongue fucks me faster. The entire time, he’s staring at me, watching shades of
pleasure flit across my face, compelling me to whine and
twist and pant in his grasp. And I watch him too. Not the entire time, but for a little
while, because he gazes at me like I’m his last supper,
moving his mouth over me like this is his only means of

messy strokes, attempting to extend the release. The sound
of his orgasm and my arousal blends in a dulcet melody. My
hand touches where we’re joined to feel his release, and he
shudders over me. “That’s my cheerleader. You love taking

It’s these words, compounded with the scalding, sticky

of wanton satisfaction. “Go on,” Silas urges, reaching down to touch himself, pumping his own shaft between my legs as it’s aching for me to tell him his next move. “And then he...” I swallow. “He fucked me with his fingers, slowly, until I begged for the rest of him.”
I’m reading to him, my own intimate interactions from dreams written in the pages of my journal. He groans against my breasts, I can feel the twitch of his cock

deeper and deeper into his taste. Their tongues dueled, wet and

Digging his dormant fingertips into the flesh of my thigh when I buck to keep me from stagnating the steady climb. Silas can feel me, like an extension of himself, start to break. My hands fling helplessly back to his hair, gripping his cheeks—thighs tensing and quaking against
the meat of his shoulders. I get so fucking wet just as I come undone, and he can feel it around his fingers, hear it in the high pitched cry stuck in my throat. “Give it to me, Eliza,” he beckons my orgasm, curling his fingers inside of my heat. “I want it all over my face.”
I clamp down on him instantly, choking out his name. Silas groans as I come on his tongue, swallowing it all and continuing to drink from me, eyes closed and content, savoring every last taste of me leaking around

into the hold of my palm with his eyes closed and head tilted back. He feels so hard and heavy and real, against my fingertips. My pussy aches, fluttering around nothing as every thrust digs the tip of him into my clit over and over
again. I’m drowning, warm and ready and slick for him—body humming with need. Silas comes to and dips his head to suck another mark into the junction of my neck and shoulder. It’s frenzied, the way he needs his mouth on me.",Forget_Me_Not_8_2

my life, coming on to this strange girl. And after
complimenting her eager behavior, I finally satisfy us both
and kiss her. At first, it’s soft pecking. It’s meant to test the water, to
gauge her instincts, but she responds immediately, parting
her lips and tilting her head to find a better angle. The tentative touch of her tongue is all I need to go for

places that hardly ever get stimulated, I’m concerned for
when he starts thrusting. I thoroughly enjoy being wrecked, but I also have to
drive home and would rather not do that with my lower half
bent out of shape. Just as I’m about to ask and maybe even add an
offhanded comment about being gentle, he wedges his

hand under the tight confines of my top and with a firm
yank, bunches it up, exposing my breasts. He grabs the
thigh not being folded back like it’s origami and wraps it
high around his waist. “We’re going to have to be quick,” he murmurs, pulling
out for a moment. He licks his hand then grazes it against
me, slipping his middle and index finger inside flawlessly,

quickly abandon that line of thought when the image of Silas and Logan at the bar reminds me of the way Silas looked sitting there with that woman last night. “Fuck,” I curse myself and slam a lazy fist against the mattress. I thought I couldn’t escape him when he only infiltrated my dreams, but this was another level. My eyes slip closed and I begin to think about him again, about the way he kissed her. I imagine the brush of his mustache against her upper lip and lift my hand
to ghost over my mouth in the same place. Against every fiber in my body screaming at me not to, I think about how it probably felt skating down the inside of her thigh, tickling the warm skin there. Instinctually I bring my hand down to touch between my legs, squeezing my eyes tighter and seeing Silas’ shoulders spreading me apart, feeling his lips kiss a line
up to my center. I sigh and push a hand beneath the band of my panties, sliding my own finger up the wet seam of my slit. With a press down, I let it dip inside of me, imagining
it’s Silas again—but the fantasy is immediately shot to hell when I hear the loud bang of a fist against the outside of the pod door. “Fuck!” I yelp in surprise, collecting myself as quickly as I can when the door starts to slide open.",Forget_Me_Not_3_36

“Ah, the kiss question,” my mother said. “I’ll leave you to it.”
I had been making my father and her tell it over and over again

“Yes, Grandma.”
She was quiet for a while longer. “I was your age, and my first

nipples. How exquisite they were on that ﬂat chest, those little
nodules that seemed so unmasculine, giving him a touch of
feminine vulnerability. How had the Queen punished them, she
wondered? Were they ever clamped and adorned as her breasts had
been? They were piquant, those little nipples. But the throbbing between her legs warned her, and it took an
act of will for her not to move her hips. ""Undress me,"" the Queen said. And from beneath her half-mast lids, Beauty watched as Prince

It was my vow, these days, never to be left alone with Katharine. Ambrose and Edmund had helped me to see what harm I had – all
unintentionally – done to her by causing her to feel for me an affection (a
love even?) that I could not return. Since understanding this, I had stayed
more aloof from her, sometimes getting Hannah or Eleanor to take over the
task of rubbing her feet and once telling her that I was too busy to stay and
listen to the stories of her past. On this night of the tarantella, however, I did sit down beside her and
took her feet in my lap and began rubbing them, being once again very

moved by her condition of sleeplessness. She sat quite still and watched me. After a few moments, she set her
doll aside, then slowly, with a self-caressing hand pulled aside her
nightgown and exposed her other breast to me. She licked her lips and
regarded me, and in her exhausted eyes I could discern a slow, sleepy, allenveloping lust. I let go of her feet and made as if to get up, but she reached

Silas sighs and chuckles, it sounds mischievous. I nearly lose my footing when he dips to suck a pebbled nipple into his mouth and bites down on the peak. “You know nothing about discretion, perfect girl,” he assures me. “I saw you that day, right here in these showers.” I let go of his dick as he lifts me to straddle
his hips. “Cowering like a shy foal behind the curtain when I caught you gawking at me.”

lifted a small cluster of glistening purple grapes and fed them to her

straight golden hair, heavy and full of a great silky density, ﬂared
down to the bed around her. She bowed her head so that the hair covered her. But she looked at the Prince and her eyes struck him as devoid of
fear or cunning. She was like those tender animals of the wood just before he slew
them in the hung: eyes wide, expressionless. Her bosom heaved with anxious breath. And now he laughed,
drawing near, and lifting her hair back from her right shoulder. She
looked up at him steadily, her cheeks suﬀused with a raw blush, and
again he kissed her. He opened her mouth with his lips, and taking her hands in his left

eyebrows knitting together when the cord finally snaps. “Where, Birdie? Where do you want it?”
“Inside—I want you inside me.”
He cries out as he loses himself. I feel it happen, ropes of his seed against my walls and the deepest parts of my body. Silas trembles the whole time and crushes
himself to me, hugging my rib cage under the weight of his arms, my chest to his chest, his head against my head. We both take time to come down, chests heaving,

lips. With a gasp I buck into his mouth, skating my fingertips down the length of my torso, tracing my hardening nipples as I go. When I cord my fingers through the short waves of his dark hair he looks up, kissing my mound as he does. “I’ll never tire of the taste of you, Birdie,” he says, dipping his tongue again into my pussy, watching me through dark, enticing eyes. I hum at the sensation, squeezing my thighs tighter and crossing my ankles behind his neck. When Silas speaks, the whispering puff of his breath against my core is already overstimulation enough to know he’s been pleasuring me for a while

was dirt in my body, he ran but was caught. He’s going to settle, formally
apologize, and we will both move on. Instead, I was told he hired a
powerful attorney, expert witnesses, private investigators who were going to
try and find details about my personal life to use against me, find loopholes
in my story to invalidate me and my sister, in order to show that this sexual

assault was in fact a misunderstanding. That he was going to go to any
length to convince the world he had simply been confused. I was not only told that I was assaulted, I was told that because I couldn’t
remember, I technically could not prove it was unwanted. And that distorted
me, damaged me, almost broke me. It is the saddest type of confusion to be
told I was assaulted and nearly raped, blatantly out in the open, but we don’t

being punctured, your air emptied. Even after the bruises healed, after the
hours of couch sitting in therapy, I was still unsure how to inhabit my body. If sex was something that hurt me, how could it provide pleasure or safety? I wanted to spackle up my holes, lock the whole place down, the machines

good behavior by this hour of leisure. I learned later that if anyone

day they had not expected anyone. ""They shrieked with delight, clapping their hands and

and she felt it too in the lobes of her clamped ears and in her eyelids. She was looking at the ﬂoor but all she could see was that
shimmering chain and some great indistinct form that was the Queen
standing over her. Then suddenly the Queen's hand struck Beauty's breasts so hard
that Beauty cried out, and at once felt the Page's ﬁngers over her

her, sending the ecstasy washing through her so she was giving great
guttural moans in spite of herself. The Prince's thrusts came faster and
faster and then he too gave a soft cry, and held her close to him, her
breasts aching and pressed to his chest, his lips on the back of her
neck, his body softening slowly. ""Beauty, Beauty,"" he whispered. ""You have conquered me as surely
as I have conquered you. Don't ever arouse my jealousy again. I don't

kissed her, half roared against her lips so she could feel the
intensity of his release melded with her own. It was fitting, for the last time to be the best time. To have a

wished, even when her ﬁngers probed his anus. She had never felt a
man in this manner before. She sat up, and made him roll on his face,

nestled into his arms and buried her head in his warm, sweet smelling

her bonds. Beauty understood at once what was happening. The Princess's
pink sex, terrifying to Beauty as it hung so unprotected, appeared to
swell, to ripen. Beauty could see tiny droplets of moisture appear on
it. And even as she watched, she felt her own sex ripening in this
same manner. She felt the hard plaster that had been placed over the
kernel of feeling there, and it seemed to do nothing to prevent the
increased throbbing. As soon as the helpless Princess had been so awakened, the man in
velvet left her with an approving smile, and continued his movement
back down the row of slaves, stopping again to tease and torment the
young blond-haired Prince who without pride or dignity pleaded from

about the club and her studies and her fears. Hell, she’d nearly forgotten her own name. All she wanted was Edwin. The moment he parked in the loop and shut off the engine, she

such warmth inside me that it took a moment to realize all the heat didn’t
come from myself. Her arms had circled around me, and mine had, as if of

fist just below her lips, the one between her thighs rubbing
vigorously. Coupling these visuals with the sensation of her
gentle suckling and tongue teasing out to collect the precum she’s drawing out, and I’m seconds away from going

take more, then make me take more.”
Just like that, I’m working on autopilot, acting from a
primal, desperate place within. Perching on the edge of the couch, I pet her face, using
a gentle touch to outline her features as I swipe my thumb

on her chin, I press it down to open her jaw, slipping my
thumb against her bottom teeth, and enunciate gruffly,
“Open that pretty mouth wide for me, G.”

He dips into my center, pulling nectar from within, and slides the finger back out again, outlining hearts against my
clit with it. “Should I be expecting trouble when we finally leave this chimeric haven?” he whispers to me. My tongue is pinched between my lips as I make breathy little noises with every flick of his fingers. The way I grind back into him is overt now, I can feel the
bulbous length of him dotting my ass, smearing precome against my thighs. “No,” I mumble. “I don’t—I don’t think so.”

wrap my hand around her neck and tilt her head back,
placing my lips to her ear, punctuating my words carefully. “Be a good girl, and grab”—I bite the side of her neck
—“the”—I tease my cock against her—“fucking”—I tighten
my hold around her throat—“headboard.”

pajama pants. His palm dragged over the curve of her ass before
his fingers dipped lower, sliding through her slit. Cassia’s breath hitched when he plunged a finger inside,
stroking her inner walls. His cock twitched between them, his arousal hardening
against her belly. “You’re soaked for me, aren’t you, beauty?”
“Yes,” she whispered, reaching between them for his cock. She’d just wrapped him in her fist when his fingers toyed with her
again, plunging in and out, spreading her wetness through her
folds. She wanted him in her mouth, except before she could drop to
her knees, his finger rose, pressing against her back entrance. Cassia gasped. Did she want that? A thrill shot through her body, just like their
first night two weeks ago when they’d watched that other couple
have sex outside Treason.",Ivy_14_11

and my lips. 'All this belongs to me,' she said, 'and this,' and she touched the
nipples of my chest which the kitchen boys had never spared, and
she touched my belly and my navel. 'And this,' she said, 'this too,
belongs to me,' and she held my penis in her hand, her long nails
scratching at the tip of it gently. It gave oﬀ a little ﬂuid then and
she withdrew her hand and held my scrotum in her hands and
claimed that as well. 'Spread your legs,' she said and turned me on
the chain that held me. 'And this is mine,' she said, touching my
anus. ""I heard myself answer her, 'Yes, your Highness.' She then told
me she had punishments worse, for me than the kitchen should I
ever try to escape her again, or rebel or in any way displease her. But for the time being, she would be more than pleased with me,

my gaze, before her eyes fluttered closed and she kissed me again. She
moved down to my wrist, where the veins flickered blue and green beneath
my skin, and there I felt the first slick stroking of her tongue. My eyes
closed too, it felt so good, but I opened them again, for I could not bear not
to watch her. She bit lightly at my wrist, so light there was not even the ghost of pain,
just another shiver. She undid the small buttons of my sleeve, one by one,

blessing each new inch of skin that she exposed with another kiss. We were on the bed by then; I don’t know how. I did not kiss her again,
but I touched her too, all over: I touched the arch of her lower back, and the
curve of her belly, and her breasts. I undid the lacing of her coarse linen
dress while she worked at my jet buttons, and we laughed together at the
labor of it, all the time it took to take off each other’s clothes. Enough time
to know we both meant everything we did. When we were both in our shifts we began to shiver; I drew the worn

against his shoulder. His thick rigid organ passed between her wet
thighs and stroked her sex roughly. Struggling not to fall, she mounted
the organ and felt it slip inside her. She thought of the village, the
auction soon to begin, all the terrors that awaited her. And when she
thought of her dear defeated Prince and her poor, grieving Lady
Juliana she was again smiling. But Prince Tristan ﬁlled her mind as he struggled, it seemed, with
his whole body to pierce her and enfold her. Even among the cries of the others, she heard his whisper behind
his gag:

his words. “Why? Cause you came in less than a minute?” I
shouldn’t find this funny, but it really is. I think this is the
fastest he’s ever come with me. Even faster than the
“quickies” we’ve had. “Give me another minute, and I’ll throw myself off your

Putting my mouth on her again, this time above the
swell of her breast, I punctuate my reply with a suggestive
thrust. “What do you want me to do?” The hand on her hip

creeps up to her ribcage to skim the clothed underside of
her breast. There’s a prolonged silence from her as I task myself
with kissing as much of her skin as I can reach. A twinge of
panic settles in me, and for the first time in a while, I
invoke on a higher power and my mom’s favorite entity:
God. Yo, I dunno if you’re really out there, but if you are,

stimulating my clit against him. I hiss, and my pussy
sinches around him. He looks as if he’s about to kiss me,
but I push him away and lean back, a devilish smile on my
face. He glares in contempt. “Fucking kiss me or ride, G. I’ll only take so much before

tongue down, staring at him all the while, before closing
around it. I bob to test his reaction, then coast my hand up

his thigh and grab hold of his dick, relishing in the way it
beats. Out of nowhere, he withdraws his finger to grab hold of
my chin, nudging my head up, my mouth still parted. Voracious appetite darkens his expression, the high rise of
his cheekbones and his neck stained red in arousal, his
breathing erratic. “If you’re a good girl tonight,” he whispers, his voice
gruff, leaning down to ghost this delicious promise over me,
“I’ll help fill your mouth.”
Fuck. An addictive beat of pleasure laces into my veins. My pussy throbs, and I stroke his length, squeezing the
base of him. With my pulse hammering against my throat, I
adjust the position of my head so it’s right in front of his

toga, stripping it from her body along with her panties. Only when
she was naked did he stand, taking a step away from the bed so
his gaze could trail over her skin. Not an inch went unnoticed. It was the sort of inspection that would have made Cassie
nervous. Cassie would have reached to cover her breasts or
shifted to close her legs. But she wasn’t Cassie anymore, so she
refused to let herself move as he continued his perusal. Edwin bent for his costume on the floor, pulling out a foil

them very wide open. Beauty gave a terrible shudder. With his left hand he covered her
mouth, and behind his hand she cried softly. It seemed easier for him
with him covering her mouth and that was all right for now, he
thought. She shall be taught everything in time. And with his right ﬁngers, he found that tiny nodule of ﬂesh

spoke softly, ‘Oh, Althea. Why must it always be so complicated for us?’
His breath was warm against the top of her head as he kissed her hair
gently. Suddenly, it all seemed very simple to her. When he bent to kiss her
ear and the side of her neck, she turned her mouth to meet his and closed her
eyes. Let it happen, then. She felt him tug her shirt loose from her trousers. The skin of his hands
was rough but his touch was gentle as his hands slid up under her shirt. One

their knees and could stand around me as they liked. At once the
round handle of a paddle was thrust in my anus. My legs were
dragged wide apart. I was shuddering, and when the paddle handle
proceeded to rape me with back and forth thrusts as roughly as any
cock I'd ever received, I knew my face was red, and that my tears
were threatening. Now and then in the midst of all this, I'd feel cool
little lips pressed to my ear, my face pinched, my chin stroked, and
then they would assault my nipples again. ""'Beautiful little tits,' said one of the girls as she did this. She had

ﬂaxen hair, as straight as yours. 'When I've ﬁnished my work, they'll

get his, I’ve got to put myself first to ensure I also get mine. The knot of tension that collects in my gut swells just in
time. Eyes fluttering shut, I focus and drown myself in the
stimulations—the taste, the touch, the smell, the sounds. It’s just as I’m about to topple over, his hand moving
over mine to help reinforce this finish, that he grabs my

her, her lax lips were warm. Her unresponsive mouth teased his with the taste

lip between his teeth and clamps down painfully, a growl
rumbling from him while I frantically grope him over his
boxers. Delight shudders through me, and I’m growing
even more wet. He’s burning through the thin cotton material, and I can
only salivate at just how scorching his bare cock will feel in
my hand. My wandering fingers slither between the slot of
his underwear, and I purr as I grab hold of him, the texture
heavy and silky. His body slumps forward like he’s about to
lose footing. For a while, he lets me do what I want, his
hands sculpting my waist while mine molds his cock. “Enough,” he reprimands with a snarl when my thumb
brushes over his slit, his body jerking in response. He
kisses me passionately and bends me back to grab at my
ass, squeezing it harshly before delivering a gentle smack

turned its face into the light. “Oh!” Patricia said. The harsh white beam picked out every detail with unforgiving clarity. The old woman squatted in a pink nightgown, cheeks smeared with red jam,
lips bristling with stiff black hairs, chin quivering with clear slime. She
crouched over something dark in her lap. Patricia saw a raccoon’s nearly
severed head hanging upside down over the old woman’s knees, tongue
sticking out between its bared fangs. The old woman reached one gory hand
into its open belly and scooped up a fistful of translucent guts. She raised

your face,” he warns, but he caresses my cheeks while I
swallow more of him, my mouth buzzing with satisfaction. I
twirl my tongue along the tip, giddy from the tangy drops
of cum leaking out of him and mixing with the saliva
collecting in my mouth. He hooks a finger under my chin right as he thrusts
forward and I break away, a string of spit hanging between
us before I lick my lips, still working him with my hands. “I
wouldn’t mind. I’m due for a facial, anyway.”
He chokes on an inhale and grows even more frantic. When he finally gets the packet undone, I’m stroking his

the little bundle of nerves there, which has me arching into his mouth, holding him against me while he works. It feels amazing, but it isn’t enough. My body demands the friction of him inside of me, so I pull him up by his chin and guide him on top. “I need you to fuck me.”
He kisses me roughly, pulling the zipper down on his pants and I wrestle them off his legs until he’s hard at attention and grinding himself against the wet center of
my body. “Like this?” he asks, pressing the tip of himself inside of me and pulling back out again. “Tell me how you want it.”

would accept anything, the twitch of an eyelid, the flaring of a nostril. There

with his breath. Squire Felix walked back and forth restlessly. Then he looked at
the Prince, and it seemed he turned his head from left to right as
though listening. Beauty held her breath. She was terriﬁed she might

make my way back up, gagging all the while, a sound he’s
very fond of. Then it gets to be too much for me to take and I pop off
him with a gasp. His cock continues to pulse, jets of his

darkness seemed very close around her and the walls seemed very far away. A fever seized her as she unsnapped her bra and shucked it off, then kicked
her clothes into one corner and threw her brassiere on top. She felt the cool air of a stranger’s house on her bare breasts and hips and
belly. Through the window she heard some family let out a mindless cheer,
barely audible, like the shore roaring in a seashell or something half
imagined carried on the wind. He pointed to the bed, and she walked over to it and sat down. He stood
before her, outlined dark in the moonlight. His broad shoulders and narrow
waist, his thick thighs and long legs, the strong jaw, the full head of hair. She found where his eyes would be and saw a faint shimmer of white in the

twined around my neck, curbing the movement of her hips. “What’s so funny, Princess? Share some of the giggles.”
“You’re burning up for me, sweetheart. I just know

It’s a divine rediscovery. The push and pull we torture each other with isn’t unlike what goes on in my head. He is the man I’ve always known, how he kisses

did not know what was worse, the little shock of pain, or the
violation of it. Her head was pulled so far back she was now resting it in the
Queen's lap, and she felt her own sobs rising up out of her chest and
out of her lips almost languidly. ""I am defenseless, I am nothing,"" she found herself thinking as
she had thought it on the Bridle Path in the midst of the worst
exhaustion. The belt licked her breast. It was no more than she
could bear, and it did not even occur to her to lift her arms, though
her pubis was ﬂooded with warm pain. Her sobs had a delicious
release for her. She felt herself growing limp, yielding. She felt the Queen's hand
caressing her chin, and then she realized Lady Juliana had dropped
down before her in a ﬂurry of pink silk and was kissing her throat
and her shoulders. ""There, there,"" said the Queen, ""my brave little slave...""

of Prince Alexi again and she wanted to shower him with kisses. She
wanted to kiss his eyelids and the nipples of his chest; she wanted to
suckle his organ. Now she saw a young Prince brought over on his hands and knees
to suck the penis of another. And as he performed the act with great
enthusiasm, he in turn was paddled by the Page who seemed, as all
others, to take delight in inﬂicting torment. The Prince's eyes were
closed, he drew on the powerful sex of the other with long caresses of
his lips, his own buttocks ﬂinching with each blow, and as the poor
Prince whom he suckled seemed on the edge of culminating passion,
the suckler was pulled back by the Page who took his obedient slave
to yet another erect penis. ""Here, as you can see, the young slave Princes are taught their
manners,"" Lord Gregory said, ""to be ever in readiness for their masters
and mistresses. A hard lesson to learn and one which you are, in
general, spared. It is not that readiness isn't required of you; it is that
you are spared having to make such a display of it.""
He led her on closer to the female slaves who were being worked
in a diﬀerent manner. Here Beauty saw a lovely red-haired Princess

that little nodule between her legs. Her hips rose and fell; it was clear
she could not control her own movement.",The_Claiming_of_Sleeping_Beauty_7_11

biceps and shoulder blades move, the contours of his bare,
intricately-inked back flexing as he undertakes this
mundane chore, has my well-fucked muscles quaking. Smoker Guy leaps upright when he finishes the task. I
nearly get whiplash from how quickly I jerk out of sight,
busying myself. No matter how attractive a man might be, I’ll never be

a hand between us so I can rub myself to completion,
needing that extra layer of friction to go off. A scream of frustration rattles in my chest but is cut
short when he speaks. “D’you want to come?” he snarls, holding himself still
inside me. Mobility limited, voice robbed, I open my eyes,

smirk dons his lips, and he tightens his hold deliciously

touching the tip of Prince Alexi's penis. Then he took Prince Alexi by the hair and lifted his head. ""Open it,"" he said softly. Immediately Prince Alexi moved to put his lips to the seam in the
Prince's breeches. With a skill that amazed Beauty he unsnapped the
hooks that concealed the Prince's bulging sex, and revealed it. The
organ was enlarged and hardened, and Prince Alexi freed it from the
cloth now and tenderly kissed it. But he was in great pain still and
when the Prince thrust the organ into Prince Alexi's mouth he was not
prepared for it. He fell backward a little on his knees and had to reach
for the Prince, caressingly, to stop himself from falling. But

Beauty was frightened by this. Her nipples felt painfully hard to
her; she knew her face had colored darkly. It seemed all the feeling in
her breasts swelled and pumped towards those tiny hard nipples. Mercifully, Leon let go of her breasts with a hard squeeze. But then
he parted her legs and rubbed the oil into her inner thighs, and this

him he’s still yet to move. It pulls a dark, latent curse from his throat and before I can giggle he pulls back and fills me again, stealing the breath and replacing it with
something tortured. Silas fucks me slow at first, winding his hips in soft circles and short thrusts. He stays as deep inside my pussy as he can, giving me his full length heavy and hard
while I’m pinned underneath him. He hardly ever lets his lips leave my body. If they’re not on my mouth, or my neck, sucking dark marks into the meat of my chest—it’s because he’s leaned
back to watch the way his cock slides in and out of me, tugging at the skin there as it comes and goes, glistening thick with my juices, with his. “You were made for me,” Silas praises, thrusting into me harder. “Maker—fuck keep going.” I sigh.",Forget_Me_Not_8_14

thank you. I’m going to miss you like crazy. I thank you.” My arms circled his

and grabs my face, silencing me. This kiss is unlike any of the ones we’ve shared before. It’s hard to describe why that’s the case. The technique is
the same. There’s nothing different about how our mouths
move. It’s a familiar dance with our tongues, our lips
opening and closing, sucking, drawing patterns. Even the

Felix, sucking it ﬁlled her with such sudden passion. She must have moaned or stirred because Prince Alexi, glancing up
at the distant pavilion before he bent over the table to gather some
sweet, suddenly kissed her on the ear, brushing Leon aside as if he
were nothing. ""You behave yourself, you wicked Prince,"" said Leon, but it was not
playful. ""I shall see you tomorrow night, my dearest,"" Prince Alexi
whispered with a smile. ""And don't be frightened of the Queen for I

""O, no, no..."" Beauty wailed, tossing her head from side to side. ""Don't be foolish. This is very good. You could not wish for better,""

like stone against her hip. God, she was going to come if he kept this up. Fully clothed in
flannel pajamas, she was going to orgasm from a kiss alone. She lifted a leg, wanting to wrap it around his hip and use the
friction to relieve her ache, but before she could hook her leg
around his, he was gone, tearing his mouth away and stalking to
the opposite end of the kitchen. Ivy blinked, working to clear the fog from her mind. She put

toes. Holy shit, this man could kiss. He nipped and sucked and
devoured her. The couple screwing got louder and louder. The woman cried
out as the man grunted, each of them finding their release. And
through it all, Edwin kissed her, until she felt like she would come

my thighs, the peppered fuzz of unseen hair. “Don’t get bashful on me,” he teases, crooking a finger to gesture for me to sit up in front of him. I concede, folding back up again, and the height is just about
perfect where his dick bobs to life, dripping sticky and hopeful in my eye line. My lashes flicker up at him, lips parting like they want to ask a question—one that Silas answers with less than a nod of his head. I reach for him, tying my
fingers in tight little ropes around it first and then open my mouth and let the velvet beginning of his cock sit heavy on my tongue. Silas sighs through gritted teeth and lifts the camera again. “You look so pretty with my dick in your mouth, Eliza.”
The flash doesn’t take though, we’re both ripped away from the absorption the same way thunder shakes you awake in the night. Stunned to paralysis by a

serving to remind me of how my kisses with Otis feel. It’s
not that kissing James is unpleasant, but kissing Otis is
passionate. When we break apart, we pause to smile at each other,

sneaks beneath my hoodie to settle between us, eager
fingers brushing against the warm skin of my abdomen,

exposed skin above her shorts. I take a small step forward,
effectively eliminating any room for Jesus. My thigh
separates her legs, rubbing at the apex. Naturally, she
hooks one over my hip, and I bite back a bellied moan. Even through my sweatpants, I notice how hot her pussy is. And goddamn, my body can’t help but react. I gyrate
against her, my dick twitching to life. “Fuck,” she pants, tearing away to swallow gulps of air. She tosses her head back.",Midnight_Kisses_1_29

looked at her. Her nipples were a rosy pink as were her lips, and the
hair between her legs was darkly yellow and curlier than the long
straight hair of her head which covered her arms almost down to her
hips on either side of her. He cut the sleeves away, lifting her ever so gently to free the cloth,
and the weight of her hair seemed to pull her head down over his
arm, and her mouth opened just a little bit wider. He put his sword to one side. He removed his heavy armor. And
the he lifted her again, his left arm under her shoulders, his right had
between her legs, his thumb on top of her pubis. She made no sound; but if a person could moan silently, then she
mad such a moan with her whole attitude. Her head fell towards him,
and he felt the hot moisture against his right had, and laying her
down again, he cupped both of her breasts, and sucked gently on one

core. Too long. It had been too long. The only things separating
them were his jeans and the thin leggings she’d pulled on earlier. She’d planned to spend an hour in the gym downstairs before
dinner, a long workout to burn off some of her pent-up energy. But

and nothing turns me on more than watching someone
unravel from my mouth alone. My imagination runs wild, my pussy pulsing in delight at
the mere prospect of getting him hard and swallowing him
whole. The silence lingering in the room is long, the air
between us charged. He cuts the tension with a guttural,
“Like what you see?”
Smoker Guy motions toward his body with one elegant
swoop of his hand, the other resting on his hip, his stance
open like he hasn’t an iota of modesty, like he trained

examining her buttocks and prodding even at that tiny and most
concealed of openings. She couldn't help but moan, but she kept her lips tightly shut, and
the tears fell down her cheeks. And for one instant she thought of nothing but what she had
glimpsed an instant ago before the procession of Lords and Ladies had
intercepted her vision. High up along the wall of the Great Hall, on a broad stone ledge,
she had glimpsed a row of naked women. It had not seemed possible, but she had seen it. They were all of
the young like herself, and they stood with their hands clasped behind
their necks as the Prince had taught her to do, and their eyes were
down, and she could see the glow of the ﬁre on the curl of pubic hair
between each pair of legs, and the swelling, pink nipples of their
bosoms. She could not believe it. She did not want it to be so, and yet if it
were so...well...again only confusion. Was she all the more terriﬁed, or

lips breaking apart with a sucking sound as he pecks me

myself around him and devour him whole, but then he pulls
away completely. Silence hangs. When he finally speaks, his words come
out in a gruff gasp. “Are you going to mean it this time?”
“Mean what?” I’m in a daze, desire fogging my
judgment. I can’t even remember why I woke him up in the

Michael crawled back up my body, stretching himself alongside me. He

Michael’s hand came to her breast, her nipple pebbling
beneath her thin top and sports bra. He cupped her, roughly, just
the way he knew she wanted it. Needed it. Because rough was
the only way she could get off. Because she truly was as fucked up as most people thought. A throat cleared from the hallway. Michael tore his lips away as they both looked to the source of

touched his precious flowers.",Ivy_4_88

from the back of his neck so they went silently and obediently to his
sides. Beauty gasped. Prince Alexi was smiling at her again, secretly as
his shadow fell over her, and she felt his lips close over hers and the
shock of his kiss pass through her. She could feel that misery between her legs formed into a tight
know, and when his lips touched her left breast and then the right, she
bit into her lower lip so hard she might have drawn blood. Prince
Alexi's hair stroked her cheek and her breasts as he carried out the
command and then he stood back with that same beguiling
equanimity. Beauty put her hands to her face before she could stop herself. But immediately the Prince took them away. ""Look well, Beauty. Study this example of the obedient slave. Become accustomed to him so that you do not see him but rather the

night before, she felt the painful prickling of the jewels. The Prince knelt over her straddling her, and then opened her
mouth with his ﬁngers, and showing her his hard penis, drove it into
her mouth with a quick downward motion. She sucked on it, drew on
it. Yet all she need do was lie back helpless for he made the strong
thrusts himself, into her, and she closed her eyes, smelling the
delicious fragrance of his pubic hair, and tasting the saltiness of his
skin, the penis nudging the back of her throat again and again as it all
but bruised her lips. She was moaning in time with its movements, and when suddenly

it. “Beg,” he says. I bite my bottom lip, giggling at him, but not giving in. He continues, cupping that same breast in his hand and leaning down to lap my peak into his mouth. He stares at me as he sucks on the tender flesh,
bringing a whimper to my lips when he scrapes his teeth over the bud. The untended nipple receives the same attention from him then—keeping the first caught between his fingers as he licks at the other.

with a last driving motion. Hot ﬂuids ﬁlled her, and she lay back
gasping. She lay against his chest. He cradled her, rocked her, never stopped
kissing her. And when she sucked his nipples, bit at them playfully with her

against one another, testing the depths they can explore. When I release his mouth I take the skin with me, biting the flesh and pulling back until I hear him groan at
the pain, then I lick it away. My breasts are hard against his chest, delighting at the friction as they slide against the damp, warm skin. Silas holds my lower back with a strong forearm,

dominance. Clapping a hand over his mouth to silence him, I reach
behind me, grabbing hold of his cock. I drag my fingers
over him slowly, his girth impressive, his length punishing. His eyes close, and I feel the vibrations of his pleasure on
my hand when he moans. He trembles, hands crushing my

her form shifted, and it was Eric, the face from the locket, the boy in
Jamaica whose sweet, imaginative letters had sustained me through lonely
years. I welcomed him as I had welcomed her and pulled his face to mine
for a kiss I’d long imagined. And even in dream I felt the kiss deeply, felt
the wonderful pressure of his body against mine, and I was glad and
grateful that our bodies had found each other after such a long
companionship of the mind. I pulled away to look at him and his face was
