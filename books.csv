Midnight_Kisses_14_46,"Yours was just impossible. It’s like a fucking
chastity belt back there.”
“Given how un-chaste our fucking was, I’d beg to differ.”
I open my mouth to argue back but she places a finger on
my lip. “A chastity belt prohibits access, and I’ve definitely
given you lots of access to me.”
“Yeah, well…” I purse my lips and choose not to expand.
For the record, I am phenomenal at ridding people of their
undergarments. Absolutely spectacular. A connoisseur.
Today just happens to be an off day of sorts. An anomaly

that should not be held against me or my record. Still,
needing to divert her attention from picking on my poor
bra-removing skill, I thus occupy her.
First, I lick my way into her mouth, evading her eager
tongue. When she’s sufficiently exasperated, her nails
cutting my skin painfully—wonderfully—Greta settles
herself properly onto my lap, straddling a single thigh,
grinding her cunt there. My kisses turn fervent, matching
the way her wet, slippery heat rubs against my skin.
I tear away and drag my lips to her breasts. Sucking her
nipple into my mouth, a sound of satisfaction rises in my
throat."
Midnight_Kisses_14_45,"I titter apprehensively, letting my fingers
trail down her spine to settle under the stringy elastic of
her thong.
“Did you…” She pauses to face me and looks down at
her chest. With the lack of support, her bra straps have slid
halfway down her arms, revealing the edge of her kobichacolored nipples. “Did you just rip my bra?”
“What can I say? I’m innovative with my solutions.” My
fingers clench the top of her ass in apology.
“But I really liked this bra.”
I liked it, too. It’s ornate and nude colored, blending into
her skin, her perky nipples making occasional appearances
based on how the sheer lace shifts.
But no matter how much I might have liked it, no matter
how pretty or sexy I think she looked in it, I know its
rightful place is anywhere off her.
“I’ll buy you a new one.” Fuck, I’m going to eat air for a
week. Those boulder holders are expensive as shit. This I
know from various heart-attack-inducing shopping trips
with my sisters. Taking Monica bra shopping is one of my
layers of hell.
Greta glares at me and shakes her head ruefully. The
hand she has on my jaw moves to curl behind my ears,
playing with my hair there. “So much for having taken off
plenty of bras before, huh,” she mocks.
“I have!"
Midnight_Kisses_14_51,"I
can’t take it anymore, and I’m trying not to be a fucking pig
about it, but it’s difficult. And when I look down at her after
trying to thrust up into her mouth, I notice the way she
stares up at me. It’s the same look she gave me when she’d
asked me to choke her.
Like she knows. She knows what she’s doing to me. And
that’s when I know what needs to be done to expedite my
escape from this purgatory.
“Suck my cock,” I command. I don’t hesitate to press her
face down. She’s a fucking brat and lifts off me, a string of
saliva stretching between us before she licks her lips and
snaps it, swallowing the excess. My pulse drums loudly in
my chest at the sight of myself in her dainty grip.
“Isn’t that what I’m doing?” She noses the underside,
pecking my balls while stroking me off leisurely, her grip
growing more lax.
My eyes narrow, and I push her head closer to my dick,
bumping it against her slightly parted lip. Rubbing the top
over her bottom lip, I paint them in a sheen of cum. “Quit
fucking talking and work that slutty mouth of yours over
my cock.”
Greta’s eyes roll into the back of her head, and she
hums, opening her mouth again."
Forget_Me_Not_5_40,"It’s never been this real,
this forthright. He’s fuck drunk off the sounds I make alone.
“Sing for me, little bird,” he says. “Show me where to find you.”
I answer with mumbled praise and half baked pleading. He wants to hear me come apart for him, and I want to make it impossible to forget.
He rocks harder into me, and I curl my fingers into the skin of his back and rake them down his spine.
“Yes—Gods, yes. Please, just like that.”
Silas could come right now, in a snap, with the way my insides rub against him—fitting like a perfect glove over his cock. There’s been a spark deep in his gut
threatening to ignite since I first touched him, and it’s growing increasingly hard to ignore.
“Feels so, fuck—fucking good,” I mumble through bitten lips. The cork is slipping with every thrust of his dick inside me.
“I know, Birdie.” He breathes. “I know.”

I take to his neck, leaving a trail of my own markings and lashes in the tan skin, then wrap my arms around him—clinging desperately to the last thrumming of
resolve we both have.
Silas’s hands skate under my ass, pulling me further to the edge of the counter. It’s an angle I wasn’t expecting so abruptly that I do nothing short of scream. The
devastating change of pace and hard ridge of his dick riding over a pleasure point inside of me has my eyes rolling back, my open mouth making rounded shapes as
I coo.
“I’m gonna...” I stutter."
Midnight_Kisses_35_4,"I’m sure that by the end of this, I’ll have
him bald, my hold on his scalp violent.
Coiling a hand around my body, he brings his free hand
to my thick lips and pinches them together, forcing the
engorged nerve bundle out of its hood. He sucks loudly, his
tongue lapping out to swipe horizontally against it. Every
sound I make is answered by one of his own.
“You’re so good to me,” I say, panting when I get close.
Fireworks dance in front of my eyes. The end is near, and I
don’t know whether I should mourn or celebrate.
“I’ll be even better when I’m inside you,” he croons, the
pitch of his voice low. And that’s all it takes. He keeps
nibbling, keeps licking, keeps doing everything he can to
get me there. Intense waves of heat dance beneath the
surface of my skin. One more twist of his wrist, one more
suck, and a circular twirl of his tongue, and I’m letting go,
rewarding him with the proof of his efforts by a rush of
arousal.
He’s right there, taking it all in, tongue wiggling deep
inside me to beckon for more. The waves of my orgasm
have me contorting in pleasure. I’m sensitive, but Otis

doesn’t care."
Midnight_Kisses_20_15,"“You scared the absolute shit out of me,”
I exclaim. “What’re you doing here? Are you trying to
apologize for being such a jealous ass? I get that you might

want something more out of this, Morgan, but I’ve made
myself perfectly clear and if you can’t—”
Otis dangles something green and red just above the
window frame, cutting off my monologue. I don’t get a
proper glimpse of it before he leans his head into my car
and grabs my face, silencing me.
This kiss is unlike any of the ones we’ve shared before.
It’s hard to describe why that’s the case. The technique is
the same. There’s nothing different about how our mouths
move. It’s a familiar dance with our tongues, our lips
opening and closing, sucking, drawing patterns. Even the
way he licks his way inside, oscillating between passionate
and teasing, is the same, the sounds of our wet kisses the
same, too.
But it’s different, the intensity of it all. His breath comes
out heavier, hotter, through his nostrils, or on a sudden
exhale when we break apart for the briefest of seconds to
readjust."
Midnight_Kisses_20_29,"I slant and position
my torso over her even more to nuzzle my nose against her
neck, fighting away a grin. I feel her every whimper, her
hips grinding.
This time, when I leave a sharp sting on her ass, I do it
in a desperate need to possess her, to leave my mark on
her.
We go at it like this for a while. I only slap her ass one
more time before she says her safe word, our night
together from two weeks ago still affecting her.
But that doesn’t mean she wants me to go soft on her.
She’s quick to make clear just how badly she needs to be
wrecked by me. I angle her and thrust downward, our
sticky flesh beating together to create a concerto with the
moving furniture and our moans.
“Yes,” she shrills, spasming around me, holding me
hostage in her luxurious depths. A sob escapes her when I

circle my hips to bump against her favorite spot as she
works her sensitive clit with her hand.
I’m high on her pleasure, each sound she makes tabbed
as a new favorite of mine. “You’re a dirty girl, aren’t you?” I
taunt. “A dirty, slutty girl that likes how hard I fuck this
tight, gorgeous pussy.”
She presses her cheek into the table, but I know the cool
surface offers no respite from the fire building in her body.
“I love when you fuck what’s yours, Otis.”
My name slips from her lips like it was meant for her,
and immediately, sanity eludes me. At first, it’s brutal but
slow. I have her blubbering, plowing so deep that her knees
buckle and she clutches the ends of the table. When I slide
back out, I do so completely, making her whimper from the
loss while I stroke my length, delighting in how slick it is
from her, before slamming ferociously into her again."
Midnight_Kisses_15_4,"I’ve never felt more
vulnerable in my life.
We’re quiet for a couple minutes, trying to catch our
breaths, not looking at each other. I’m still trying to find my
sanity, what with her having slurped it out of me.
I turn to look at her, fucked out and hazy. Greta is so
fucking dazzling, just sitting there pensively, unashamed of
her naked form. She has a faraway look in her eyes but
notices my movement from the corner of her eyes and
mimics my posture. I take a mental picture of the moment,
of us sitting naked on the couch, looking at each other.
“Did you get off again?” I ask, my voice cracking, throat
dry.
She nods sluggishly, and when she speaks, her voice is
even more hoarse, strained from her majestic oral efforts.
“I really like giving blowjobs.”
That’s a fucking understatement.

There’s another lull of silence before I speak up again.
“So, are we going to talk about the fact that you screamed
out Rutherford when you climaxed earlier?”
She winces. “Absolutely not.”
“Cool, cool, cool.” You almost made me go soft, but
that’s okay. We’ll move past it.
“Are we going to talk about the fact that you started
singing the Ben Ten theme song?”
“What?” I balk, horrified. “When?”
“When you were ramming your dick into my mouth like
a mammoth on steroids.”
I pale in horror. I don’t remember doing that. The last
time I did something like that was in my freshman year of
college."
Forget_Me_Not_8_13,"“‘Do you need something from her?’ Seriously?”
“I will not apologize for possessiveness, Eliza.” He pulled me by my wrists to stand between his legs. “All my life you have been the only thing I could
truly call my own, and that will not be made an exception.”
Silas drops the camera slowly to rest against the hood of his stomach, it sways there until it settles and I’m satisfied with the change of attention. His smile is
warm, the touch of his fingertips to my knee much more of a candle-waxed burn.
“Can I offer you something, sweetheart?” His voice drips in budding innuendo.
I let the same knee he’s putting pressure on fall open, welcoming the cool air against the puffy, tender lips of my core. I’m all shiny and swollen, glistening with
the remnants of myself and of him where he still drips out of me. Silas hums contentedly, that familiar darkness shining now through his downcast eyes.
“You’re a vision, little bird,” he says as he runs a thick finger through the valley there, pushing his spend back inside, making me quiver. He picks the camera up
again, lifting the viewfinder to his eye and focusing the lens between my legs. “I should take a picture.”
The bright flash stuns a girlish yelp out of me, it makes me giggle and fall back against the sheets with a forearm over my eyes.
“I can finally immortalize you,” Silas says. “Something that proves you were really here.”
I simper again, shy all of a sudden, as if the flash is showing off any piece of myself he hasn’t already burned into his memory. The soft stripes of growth inside
my thighs, the peppered fuzz of unseen hair.
“Don’t get bashful on me,” he teases, crooking a finger to gesture for me to sit up in front of him. I concede, folding back up again, and the height is just about
perfect where his dick bobs to life, dripping sticky and hopeful in my eye line.
My lashes flicker up at him, lips parting like they want to ask a question—one that Silas answers with less than a nod of his head."
The_Girl_With_The_Dragon_Tattoo_22_27,"When she came back, Mikael said a single word to her.
“Gottfried.”
She nodded.
“On August 7, 1965, my father forced me to go out to his cabin. Henrik was away. My father was drinking, and he tried
to force himself on me. But he couldn’t get it up and he flew into a drunken rage. He was always … rough and violent
towards me when we were alone, but this time he crossed the line. He urinated on me. Then he started telling me
what he was going to do to me. That night he told me about the women he had killed. He was bragging about it. He

quoted from the Bible."
Midnight_Kisses_21_21,"When I roll
back onto my side, I place a hand on his cheek, and he
closes those sad eyes to burrow into the touch.
I get it.
“What about you? That tattoo that you have here.” He
presses a kiss just above my heart. “Why’d you get it?”
I, too, try to play it off. “If I said it was commemorating
my past relationship with James, what would you do?”
His lips fight a grin as he lightly swats my thigh “Don’t
test me, woman.”
My laughter continues until it dwindles into short,
uneven chuckles. When it dies out, I settle deeper into his
hold and press my cheek against his chest, the corner of my
mouth tugging down. “It doesn’t say James.”
“Then who?” And the way he asks, the way his body
goes stiff, the corners of his eyes crinkling, makes me
suspect he knows already.
Which doesn’t ease the knot that turns in my gut. Do it.
There’s no point in keeping it a secret. It’s not even a
secret. I bet Elise blabbed. Someone has got to superglue
her mouth shut.
“Julien.”
Recognition flares in his eyes.
“He’s my younger brother.” Was."
Midnight_Kisses_14_38,"A
smirk dons his lips, and he tightens his hold deliciously
around my neck, holding me down more. The edge of my
orgasm grows closer. “Then beg me.”
If I were in my right mind, I’d push him off me and give
him the finger for being such an ass about this. But I’m not.
I’m on some dumb shit, hypnotized by his dick, and without
even hesitating, the second he loosens his hold around my
throat, maintaining the grip with none of the pressure, I’m
blubbering for release, fulfilling my role as the biddable
partner.
“Please let me come. Please. You feel so good and I can’t
—fuck—more. Harder. Please. Yes. Yes."
Midnight_Kisses_1_23,"He stalks across my living
room as I slip off my bottoms and peel my top off. Unlike
him, I neatly pool my clothes at my feet. Raven scolds my
promiscuity with a meow and walks away, disgusted.
Prude.
I hook my thumb under the thin material of my thong,
pausing long enough for him to lick his lips expectantly.
“Do you want to take these off, or should I?” I pose. He’s
standing in front of me, leaving enough room to make my
skin burn.

“Depends,” he murmurs, reaching over to trace his
knuckles below my navel. “You attached to this thong?”
“Not particularly.”
That’s all the permission he needs to rip them off. In the
next instance, we collide together. It’s skin against skin,
every inch of me touched by his warmth. My hands find
purchase on his pert ass, pressing him further into me, the
thick column of his dick wedged against my abdomen. My
pussy flexes at the thrill of our physical proximity.
How we navigated to the bed, I’ll never know. All I know
is that the second our bare flesh rubs together, there’s an
explosion of sorts.
The kisses we share differ from before."
Forget_Me_Not_2_31,"“You don’t know if you’ll satisfy me?”
He turns his head and nuzzles the soft hair above his lip against my wrist, not breaking eye contact with me as he does.
“You haven’t made love to me in days, maybe you can’t...”
He cuts me off. “Birdie, don’t delude yourself. You know I’m not one to feign naivety—the satisfaction isn’t lacking if you’re here begging for it.”

Against his promises he lets me straddle his lap, pressing myself firmly into the junction of his hips. I feel the way he hardens instantly. Silas runs his
thumbs back and forth against my smooth skin and leans forward to press a chaste kiss to the valley between my breasts.
I smirk at him when he meets my eyes again, rolling my hips lightly over his. “So make me beg then.”
Without another word he licks a thick stripe up the middle of my chest to the dip of my collarbones, kissing the skin there before nudging his sharp
nose against my neck and trailing it up to my ear. He laves at my pulse with his tongue, then bites down into it as I sigh.
My hips are rocking into him while he works, searching for the friction that makes my eyes close and my head dip back. And I find it for a second, but
Silas steals it from me just as fast—shifting his body away from my grinding core and pinching a puckered nipple between his fingers to snap me out of
it.
“Beg,” he says. I bite my bottom lip, giggling at him, but not giving in.
He continues, cupping that same breast in his hand and leaning down to lap my peak into his mouth. He stares at me as he sucks on the tender flesh,
bringing a whimper to my lips when he scrapes his teeth over the bud.
The untended nipple receives the same attention from him then—keeping the first caught between his fingers as he licks at the other.
I wrap my arms around Silas’s head and thread my fingers through his hair, holding him close to my chest."
Midnight_Kisses_14_24,"I exhale dreamily through my nose.
Otis shifts beneath me and again nudges me to relax
completely over him. I refuse still, and he grunts and moves
his fingers up my inner thigh, beneath the band of my
panties, until he’s touching the searing heat of me. I nearly
topple from the touch, my moan echoing throughout the
room.
“Fuck, Miriam,” he groans in reverence, tossing his
head to the side in disbelief as he strums his fingers over
me, coating his touch in my wetness. “You’re dripping, and
I haven’t even done anything yet. When did you get so
wet?” I don’t respond, too distracted, and he withdraws. I
pull ferociously at his hair again, more painful than kinky,
but he doesn’t flinch, steadfast in his inquiry. “Answer me.
When did you get so wet?”
“Earlier,” I bite out. I lift myself higher and gyrate
against his torso, hoping this will help cool the building
tension. It doesn’t. The pressure feels too good on my
mound, yet it serves to kindle rather than soothe.
“Earlier when?"
Midnight_Kisses_14_39,"Deeper. Fuck. Just
like that. Fuck me like I’m your slut,” I babble. And then
he’s drilling into me, robbing me of breath and autonomy
as flames lick my veins.
He’s panting. I’m moaning. He’s fucking, and I’m taking.
He’s whispering sweet nothings, and I’m feeling sharp
pinches of everything.
“Now, slut,” he commands, emphasizing the syllable
with a deep, hard, fluid thrust. He holds himself there and
leans forward to apply pressure on my mound. “Come
around me now.”
There it is.
And just like that, I’m ignited, my soul ablaze.
“Rutherford,” I screech, breaking through the sound
barrier. Every cell in my body splits to two."
Midnight_Kisses_4_19,"So, I yield.
“Fine, but you’re sleeping on the couch.”

There’s a knock at my door. I purse my lips to keep from
groaning. “Yes?”
The metal knob clangs and twists. The door to my room
creaks open. Smoker Guy pokes his head through the slight
crack he’s created, the soft glow of the hallway’s light
creating a halo around him.
“Can I sleep in here with you?”
Say “psych” right now. I sit up to peer at him properly,
unblinking. “Seriously?”
He nods and widens the door gap, a pout set on his lips.
If I wasn’t so aggravated, I’d find it adorable. He clutches
the spare pillow I’d graciously given him. “Raven keeps
jumping on me, so I can’t sleep.”
As if to testify, my pet meows and struts into the
bedroom. He leaps onto the bed with unparalleled grace,
makes bread over my duvet-covered legs, then curls his
body to rest against me."
The_Girl_With_The_Dragon_Tattoo_23_6,"You can have respect for someone, but if you don’t have trust, the friendship will crumble.”
She was still silent.
“I understand that you don’t want to discuss yourself with me, but someday you’re going to have to decide whether
you trust me or not. I want us to be friends, but I can’t do it all by myself.”
“I like having sex with you.”
“Sex has nothing to do with friendship. Sure, friends can have sex, but if I had to choose between sex and friendship
when it comes to you, there’s no doubt which I would pick.”
“I don’t get it. Do you want to have sex with me or not?”
“You shouldn’t have sex with people you’re working with,” he muttered. “It just leads to trouble.”
“Did I miss something here, or isn’t it true that you and Erika Berger fuck every time you get the chance? And she’s
married.”
“Erika and I … have a history that started long before we started working together. The fact that she’s married is none
of your business.”
“Oh, I see, all of a sudden you’re the one who doesn’t want to talk about yourself. And there I was, learning that
friendship is a matter of trust.”
“What I mean is that I don’t discuss a friend behind her back. I’d be breaking her trust. I wouldn’t discuss you with
Erika behind your back either.”
Salander thought about that."
Midnight_Kisses_20_33,"When I turn my head, Raven is looking
up at me, his judgmental face filled with reproach. My eyes
flicker to Greta, who’s resting against my chest, equally
exhausted.
She stares at Raven then looks at me with a frown.
“Yeah. I definitely have to take him to a therapist.”

You know which bitch just killed my vibe? Greta’s friend.
“What did he want?” I inquire, trying to maintain a
semblance of casualness. I stand in front of the bathroom
sink, a towel wrapped loosely around my waist, watching

keenly as she makes her way into the bathroom and lifts
her shirt while she approaches the toilet.
I’m lathering her face wash in my palms just as she
taught me, but I’m distracted, staring at her sitting on the
toilet, phone in hand.
Just two minutes ago, our harmonious post-sex routine
was disrupted by a ring of the doorbell. Rather than take a
second to get dressed, Greta decided to saunter out of the
bathroom, clad only in an oversized shirt with no bra or
panties, to answer the door, my cum still tacky on her inner
thigh. “It’s only James,” she’d said when I suggested she
put more clothes on.
“Something,” she replies vaguely, concentrating on her
phone. My face ticks in irritation.
“Something?” I repeat for emphasis. When she doesn’t
get the hint, I try again. “What something?”
“This thing he left at my place on Monday."
Midnight_Kisses_14_16,"I gladly take advantage and nose the skin there
before digging my teeth in, tugging, sucking, and kissing
until he directs my ministrations back to his mouth. A sigh
escapes me, bleeding into the kiss. He absorbs this
contented sound while I strive to drink him in, licking my
way inside, sliding my tongue languidly against his. I hold
him captive, intoxicated by the way he relinquishes control,
giving me free rein to plunder his mouth as roughly or
gently as I want. All the while, he’s attentive to me. His
hands snake under my shirt, skimming my torso, up my
waist, until settling below my breasts, the pads of his
thumb teasing under the wire of my bra.
Just as he starts to venture beneath the material to
finally touch the sensitive skin of my bare breasts, Otis
tears himself away again. This time, however, he
establishes a most unappreciated distance between us. And
he does all this just to add, “Actually, if we’re going to play
a game, I vote Settlers of Catan. But we’re gonna need
more players.”
I gape at him. He blinks back innocently, and I try to
keep calm as I carefully respond, “Did you really stop
kissing me to say that?”
He licks his puffy lips nervously and opens his mouth to
explain, only to close it again."
Know_My_Name_23_19,"One more time, in public news, I learned that my ass and vagina
were completely exposed outside, my breasts had been groped, fingers had
been jabbed inside me along with pine needles and debris, my bare skin and
head had been rubbing against the ground behind a dumpster, while an erect
freshman was humping my half naked, unconscious body. But I don’t
remember, so how do I prove I didn’t like it.
I thought there’s no way this is going to trial; there were witnesses, there
was dirt in my body, he ran but was caught. He’s going to settle, formally
apologize, and we will both move on. Instead, I was told he hired a
powerful attorney, expert witnesses, private investigators who were going to
try and find details about my personal life to use against me, find loopholes
in my story to invalidate me and my sister, in order to show that this sexual

assault was in fact a misunderstanding. That he was going to go to any
length to convince the world he had simply been confused.
I was not only told that I was assaulted, I was told that because I couldn’t
remember, I technically could not prove it was unwanted. And that distorted
me, damaged me, almost broke me. It is the saddest type of confusion to be
told I was assaulted and nearly raped, blatantly out in the open, but we don’t
know if it counts as assault yet. I had to fight for an entire year to make it
clear that there was something wrong with this situation.
When I was told to be prepared in case we didn’t win, I said, I can’t prepare
for that. He was guilty the minute I woke up. No one can talk me out of the
hurt he caused me."
Know_My_Name_16_47,"The opposite of a body that is meant to be tender,
porous, soft. Sometimes I’m too angry, seething after reading a rape story, I
need to slice a dick off. Sometimes my desire fluctuates, dips to depletion. I
wouldn’t notice if I didn’t have a partner, but once you shrug off affection
for the sixth time something’s amiss. Sometimes he’ll gesture for me to rest
my head on his chest, he just needs touch, simple touch, to know we’re still
connected.
This distancing from my body did not begin with the assault. But in a
world where self-confidence is already doled out sparingly to young
women, my supply quickly diminished in court. I spent my adolescence
soaking in oatmeal baths for my eczema. A boy called me a cheetah, so I
used Sally Hansen spray tans to paint over my spotted, discolored skin. I
wore peach-colored pantyhose in high school, a purchased epidermis.
College was the first time I started wearing dresses. Still my relationship
with my body remained halfhearted.
I wonder if there is a time in every woman’s life when she feels like
swallowing stones."
The_Girl_With_The_Dragon_Tattoo_21_47,"before he gave up and drove back to Norsjö, where he had a late dinner and then went to
bed to read the denouement of Val McDermid’s novel.
It was grisly.
At 10:00 Salander added one more name to Harriet Vanger’s list. She did so with some hesitation.
She had discovered a shortcut. At quite regular intervals articles were published about unsolved murders, and in a
Sunday supplement to the evening newspaper she had found an article from 1999 with the headline “Many Murderers
of Women Go Free.” It was a short article, but it included the names and photographs of several noteworthy murder
victims. There was the Solveig case in Norrtälje, the Anita murder in Norr köping, Margareta in Helsingborg, and a
number of others.
The oldest case to be recounted was from the sixties, and none of the murders matched the list that Salander had

been given by Blomkvist. But one case did attract her attention.
In June 1962 a prostitute by the name of Lea Persson from Göteborg had gone to Uddevalla to visit her mother and
her nine-year-old son, whom her mother was taking care of. On a Sunday evening, after a visit of several days, Lea had
hugged her mother, said goodbye, and caught the train back to Göteborg. She was found two days later behind a
container on an industrial site no longer in use. She had been raped, and her body had been subjected to
extraordinary violence.
The Lea murder aroused a great deal of attention as a summer serial story in the newspaper, but no killer had ever
been identified. There was no Lea on Harriet Vanger’s list. Nor did the manner of her death fit with any of Harriet’s
Bible quotes.
On the other hand, there was such a bizarre coincidence that Salander’s antennae instantly buzzed."
Know_My_Name_3_97,"I had spent two
weeks pumping my wings, keeping a calm face, to protect my flock from
brutal conditions. But resilience required rest. For the next eight months I
was going to fall back. The most important thing to remember was that to
be at the rear, to be slower, did not mean you were not a leader.
The next day, a lemon pie sat on the counter next to a note. In the hushed
hours of morning while I’d been sleeping, my dad had picked lemons from
the backyard, boiled sugar and eggs over the stove, pressed fingertips into
crust along the edge, sprinkled powdered sugar on top. I brought it into
work to share. I sat at my desk with my yellow slice and opened my
browser.
Stanford swimmer denies alleged rape. I almost choked, felt I’d been
slapped hard in the chest. This article had a trigger warning, this version
more graphic, I brushed it aside, clicked the police report, eyes sliding back
and forth. Throughout the night, TURNER hooked up with a few girls."
Know_My_Name_16_74,"Disappointed. Wrecked.
When Trump’s Access Hollywood tape surfaced, the average person
acknowledged what he said was vulgar, lewd, foul. Anderson Cooper asked
Trump point-blank if he understood he was talking about sexual assault and
the nation watched him shrug and say, locker-room talk. In the public we
grew tired. We heard the tape replayed one thousand times, debated two
thousand times, pussy pussy pussy, in print, on air, Democrats and
Republicans arguing, you’re inappropriate, no you’re inappropriate, until it
dulled on the ears. We grew used to the same patterns of deflect, defend,
dilute. The tape was from 2005, guys talking like guys, they wanted us to
knit our shit and move on.
The language bothered me, but what disturbed me more was the context.
All I can see is the legs. Oh, it looks good. Trump and Billy Bush were
evaluating a woman, not in passing or from memory, but on a bus that was
slowly pulling up to her. She was present, visible but excluded."

Advokat Bjurman had chosen her as a victim.
That told her something about the way she was viewed by other people.
On Friday, a week after the second rape, she walked from her apartment to a tattoo parlour in the Hornstull district.
She had made an appointment, and there were no other customers in the shop. The owner nodded, recognising her.
She chose a simple little tattoo depicting a narrow band and asked to have it put on her ankle. She pointed.
“The skin is very thin there. It’s going to hurt a lot,” said the tattoo artist.
“That’s OK,” Salander said, taking off her jeans and putting her leg up.
“OK, a band. You already have loads of tattoos. Are you sure you want another one?”
“It’s a reminder.”
Blomkvist left the café when Susanne closed at 2:00 on Saturday afternoon. He had spent the morning typing up his
notes in his iBook. He walked to Konsum and bought some food and cigarettes before he went home. He had
discovered fried sausage with potatoes and beets—a dish he had never been fond of but for some reason it seemed
perfectly suited to a cabin in the country.

There was another line of argument that nagged at me: the suggestion
that boys simply could not help themselves. As if he never had a choice. I
have told each of my girls heading off to college: If you walk in front of a

known my case was unusual.
Some weight should be given to the fact that a defendant who is, albeit
voluntarily, intoxicated versus a defendant who commits an assault with
intent to commit rape, a completely sober defendant, there is less moral
culpability attached to the defendant who is legally intoxicated. I had heard
this sentiment echoed in the probation officer’s statement. Alcohol freed
Brock of moral culpability.
The judge laid out reason after reason: he was youthful, had no prior
criminal offenses, no weapons, and the degree of monetary loss to the
victim is not really applicable. He said the crime didn’t demonstrate
criminal sophistication, Brock did not take advantage of a position of trust
or confidence to commit the crime, and registering as a sex offender was
already a consequence. Obviously, a prison sentence would have a severe
impact on him. I was struggling to comprehend, wanted to lean forward and
tap my DA, What’s happening?
He addressed the adverse collateral consequences on the defendant’s life
resulting from the felony conviction. And those are severe. He said the
character letters showed huge collateral consequences. If we punished him,
we’d hurt his community too. With respect to the media attention that’s

“But it was a year before she took any action.”
“What would you do if you found out that your father was a murderer who had been raping your brother?”

was attacking Martin Vanger. He smiled joylessly.
“OK, but Harriet wasn’t like you. Gottfried died before she managed to do anything. That also makes sense. When
Gottfried died, Isabella sent Martin to Uppsala. He might have come home for Christmas or other holidays, but during

used as an office. The man, who was three years older than Salander, was six foot two and weighed 330 pounds. She
herself was four feet eleven and weighed 90 pounds and had always felt like a midget next to Plague. The place
smelled stuffy and stale.
“It’s because you never take a bath, Plague. It smells like a monkey house in here. If you ever went out I could give
you some tips on soap. They have it at the Konsum.”
He gave her a wan smile, but said nothing. He motioned her to follow him into the kitchen. He plopped down on a

down all around, forcing him to relish this moment. Electric
shocks of ecstasy tremble through me, fizzling between us,
and we let out bitten-off moans, our mouths open against
each other, sharing the same breaths.
When it’s over, when the last tide of intense, delectable
euphoria dissipates, we look at each other. He still hovers
above me, resting a little more than half his weight atop
me. I urge him to give me all of him, loving how solid and
heavy he is. He relents, and in that moment, I feel so
entirely safe and wanted and cherished that if I had the
ability to bear the burden of him constantly, I would.
We’re talking about getting up and cleaning ourselves,

start of the school year she would take the two of us out. We marveled at her as we watched her nimble fingers play the hangers
like so many keys. Suddenly, hesitating only for a moment, she
would pull out a dress or shirt and hold it up to us. “What do you
think?” she’d ask. It was always perfect.
As she considered my separates, plucked and posed them
against my sister’s torso, she talked:

second to feel the small, sharp edges of the keystone against the
flesh of his fingers. The way he drew it out of the bag reminded
me of playing the game Operation with Lindsey when we were little. If he touched the sides of the Ziploc bag an alarm would go
off and he would have to forfeit.
“How can you be sure he killed these other girls?” my mother
asked. She stared at the tiny ember of gold in my father’s palm.
“Nothing is ever certain,” Len said.
And the echo rang in her ears again. Len had a fixed set of
phrases. It was this same phrase that my father had borrowed to
soothe his family. It was a cruel phrase that preyed on hope.
“I think I want you to leave now,” she said.
“Abigail?” my father queried.
“I can’t hear anymore.”
“I’m very glad to have the charm, Len,” my father said.
Len doffed an imaginary cap to my father before turning to go.
He had made a certain kind of love to my mother before she went
away. Sex as an act of willful forgetting."

“Walk the paths,” Franny said, “and you’ll find what you need.”
So that’s when Holly and I set out. Our heaven had an ice
cream shop where, when you asked for peppermint stick ice
cream, no one ever said, “It’s seasonal”; it had a newspaper where
our pictures appeared a lot and made us look important; it had
real men in it and beautiful women too, because Holly and I were
devoted to fashion magazines. Sometimes Holly seemed like she
wasn’t paying attention, and other times she was gone when I
went looking for her. That was when she went to a part of heaven
we didn’t share. I missed her then, but it was an odd sort of missing because by then I knew the meaning of forever.
I could not have what I wanted most: Mr. Harvey dead and
me living. Heaven wasn’t perfect. But I came to believe that if I
watched closely, and desired, I might change the lives of those I
loved on Earth.

seemed to know nothing. I knew she was hungry for nourishment, to be

want to learn more about the court system, refused therapy. You don’t need
it, I told her.
In the beginning I was good at keeping the selves separate. You would
never be able to detect that I was suffering. But if you looked closely
enough, cracks appeared. Many nights I went to sleep with my eyes leaking,
arriving at work the next morning with eyelids swollen and taut. I began
keeping one spoon in the freezer, pressing the cold metal shell to each eye
as I brushed my teeth. I sealed blocks of ice into a ziplock bag, one hand
pressing it to my face, the other on the wheel as I drove to work, listening to
KQED. In the evenings, I’d come back to my sealed bag of lukewarm water
in my cup holder, emptying it into the grass.

looked up I saw a tear rolling down her cheek. I felt a small shock,
something inside me awakening and softening. I was not in trouble. I was
not stupid. It was sad, she was sad. I was stunned.
On May 5, Alaleh informed us we’d have to reschedule the hearing due
to the defense attorney’s unavailability. The options for resetting the court
dates stretched into September. I didn’t know this was possible. My
company was small, how would I explain my strange absences? Everyone
thought I was taking time off in June, but now I’d have to tell them I’d be
gone in July or August or September."

I wondered if I was waking up to a truth that I had been the last one to
realize; you are worth three months. A smarter part of me knew this was not
right, but I could not pretend to know better. At that moment there was
nothing to do but give in. I accepted that this would be one of the most
painful nights of my life.

“Yes, far too young, in 1958. She had a congenital heart defect. And it turned out that I couldn’t have children. And

CHAPTER 10
Thursday, January 9–Friday, January 31
According to the Hedestad Courier, Blomkvist’s first month out in the country was the coldest in recorded memory, or
(as Vanger informed him) at least since the wartime winter of 1942. After only a week in Hedeby he had learned all
about long underwear, woolly socks, and double undershirts.
He had several miserable days in the middle of the month when the temperature dropped to −35°F. He had
experienced nothing like it, not even during the year he spent in Kiruna in Lapland doing his military service.
One morning the water pipes froze. Nilsson gave him two big plastic containers of water for cooking and washing,
but the cold was paralysing. Ice flowers formed on the insides of the windows, and no matter how much wood he put
in the stove, he was still cold. He spent a long time each day splitting wood in the shed next to the house.
At times he was on the brink of tears and toyed with taking the first train heading south."
The_Girl_With_The_Dragon_Tattoo_16_23,"She put her jacket on the chair, set her rucksack on the round table,
and took several hesitant steps to the bed. Then she stopped, as if she had cold feet. Bjurman came closer.
“Wait,” she said once more, in a tone as if to say that she was trying to talk sense into him. “I don’t want to have to
suck your dick every time I need money.”
The expression on Bjurman’s face suddenly changed. He slapped her hard. Salander opened her eyes wide, but
before she could react, he grabbed her by the shoulder and threw her on to the bed. The violence caught her by
surprise. When she tried to turn over, he pressed her down on the bed and straddled her.
Like the time before, she was no match for him in terms of physical strength. Her only chance of fighting back was if
she could hurt him by scratching his eyes or using some sort of weapon. But her planned scenario had already gone

to hell."
Know_My_Name_18_12,"The assault harmed me physically, but there were bigger things that
got broken. Broken trust in institutions. Broken faith in the place I thought
would protect me. Their apathy, their lack of apology I could live with, but

what troubled me most was their failure to ask the single most important
question: How do we ensure this does not happen again? They had treated
my assault like a singular, isolated incident. After Brock voluntarily
withdrew, they called me once, to inform me he was not allowed back on
campus. Other than that, little seemed to be set in motion. My assault came
and went. But nothing is ever that simple.
Brock was not one bad apple, he just threatened to expose the greater,
underlying issues of sexual violence on campus. Stanford should have taken
the opportunity to conduct a systemic review of procedures and policies."
Know_My_Name_15_19,"I felt my cheeks growing hot, suddenly

self-conscious. I was embarrassed by my behavior, my failure to conceal
my pain. Chanel is a courageous woman and should be commended for her
emotional fortitude.
I’m sorry, he said. I thought this was the assignment. You know how
strong you are, right? I nodded, tears emerging. I was a little mortified, but
mostly I was touched. When asked to write a letter about how he’d noticed
me changing, he did not say, Well I don’t know, I wasn’t there. He could’ve
kept my pain at arm’s length, a safe distance away, or removed himself
entirely. Instead he had been on the other side of the bathroom door,
listening, trying to figure out how to care for the new me.
When Tiffany sent her statement to my mom, my mom sent back a few
words: Sorry my Tiffy, Mama can’t read, cry too hard."
Know_My_Name_16_13,". .
Almost every message I received opened with someone telling me the
location of where they were crying. They were enraged and then devastated,
and then they said thank you, said everyone must read it. It was a reaction
too complex to categorize, but it sounded like, by the end of reading, they’d
emerged in a clearer space. I was taken aback by this collective murmuring,
a little worried I’d made them cry.
I watched the numbers rise. A few hours later, when it hit eight hundred
thousand views, I called my dad, telling him to go online. Buzz bee? How
can I find—can you send me the link? Lucas was on a bike trip through the
forest. When he texted me a picture of him in a helmet, I replied, Something
is happening."
Midnight_Kisses_18_28,"Being single has
fucked up your eyesight.”
My sister glares and tightly grabs the collar of my shirt,
yanking me forward with a strong jerk. “His attractiveness
has nothing to do with me being single. Being a DILF has
nothing to do with a person’s position. He might be your
coach, but he’s a daddy coach.”
“As a person who’s attracted to men, I’m going to have
to strongly disagree with you.”
“You’re just saying that because you’re boning his
daughter,” she says too loudly. “It would be totally wrong of
you to find both daughter and father attractive.”
I inhale sharply and glance out the door, panic surging
through my veins. When I stare back at my sister, my blasé
attitude disappears and I snatch the rag from her hand.
I’m so fucking done playing docile like I’ve done with
her all week. Right now, I could give two flying fucks about
how depressed she still feels over her breakup. I’m done

taking the brunt of her sardonic attitude. “You need to
learn when to shut the fuck up, Katia,” I snap, heat licking
up my neck.
She looks taken aback, my sudden shift in behavior
unpredictable, even to her, a person attuned to me.
“Not every fucking thing has to be announced or made
into a joke. Some shit you can keep to yourself."
Midnight_Kisses_36_4,"Raven, who had
previously been napping but awoke to the ruckus Otis
created with the power drill he brought up from his truck,
glares at me for touching what he believes is his. I stick my
tongue out at the cat.
I go into the kitchen and grab us both cold glasses of
water. It’s almost three in the morning, but the night isn’t
over. In order for it to be over, I’ve got to have my guts
rearranged, and that hasn’t happened yet.
Now, to get him to stop being so cranky and actually
fuck me…
I wait in bed for him to finish working on my lock. I’m
careful to keep my slightly damp hair off the pillow. We’d
taken a quick rinse after our escapade in the bathroom, one
where Otis refused to hanky-the-panky in protest of my
mean behavior. That’s fine, I’d asserted back. I was still
sensitive and had no doubt in my mind that by the time I
knocked out for the night, I’d be tucked into bed with his
spent cock inside me.
Taking this alone time to reply to the plethora of texts
from my friends and parents—my mom yelling at me for not
returning her jewelry like I promised I would, my dad angry
that my credit card statement was well over my allowance,
Elise with a barrage of texts about what we did after
ditching, and James asking me for my streaming service
password—I hardly notice when my man walks into the
bedroom. Like before, he stops at the entryway, arms up to

clutch the frame above. He rests his head on his defined
bicep.
I can’t explain it, but this dégagé display has me
instantly wet.
“Are you coming to bed?” I toss my phone aside and pat
the empty space beside me to beckon him.
He doesn’t move, and my left eye twitches."
The_Girl_With_The_Dragon_Tattoo_15_13,"Much
stronger boys in her class soon learned that it could be quite unpleasant to fight with that skinny girl. Unlike the other
girls in the class, she never backed down, and she would not for a second hesitate to use her fists or any weapon at
hand to protect herself. She went around with the attitude that she would rather be beaten to death than take any shit.
And she always got revenge.
Salander once found herself in a fight with a much bigger and stronger boy. She was no match for him physically. At
first he amused himself shoving her to the ground several times, then he slapped her when she tried to fight back. But
nothing did any good; no matter how much stronger he was, the stupid girl kept attacking him, and after a while even
his classmates began to realise that things had gone too far. She was so obviously defenceless it was painful to
watch. Finally the boy punched her in the face; it split open her lip and made her see stars. They left her on the ground
behind the gym. She stayed at home for two days."
Know_My_Name_23_40,"Your attorney’s
closing statement began, “[Her sister] said she was fine and who knows her
better than her sister.” You tried to use my own sister against me? Your
points of attack were so weak, so low, it was almost embarrassing. You do
not touch her.

You should have never done this to me. Secondly, you should have never
made me fight so long to tell you, you should have never done this to me.
But here we are. The damage is done, no one can undo it. And now we both
have a choice. We can let this destroy us, I can remain angry and hurt and
you can be in denial, or we can face it head on, I accept the pain, you accept
the punishment, and we move on.
Your life is not over, you have decades of years ahead to rewrite your story.
The world is huge, it is so much bigger than Palo Alto and Stanford, and
you will make a space for yourself in it where you can be useful and happy.
But right now, you do not get to shrug your shoulders and be confused
anymore. You do not get to pretend that there were no red flags. You have
been convicted of violating me, intentionally, forcibly, sexually, with
malicious intent, and all you can admit to is consuming alcohol. Do not talk
about the sad way your life was upturned because alcohol made you do bad
things."
The_Girl_With_The_Dragon_Tattoo_21_122,"Someone is lying.”
“And what in hell makes you think it was me?”
“This picture,” Blomkvist said, and flung the blurry photograph onto her kitchen table.
Cecilia walked over to the table and studied the picture. Blomkvist thought he could read shock on her face. She
looked up at him. He felt a trickle of blood run down his cheek and drop onto his shirt.
“There were sixty people on the island that day,” he said. “And twenty-eight of them were women. Five or six of them
had shoulder-length blonde hair. Only one of those was wearing a light-coloured dress.”
She stared intently at the photograph.
“And you think that’s supposed to be me?”
“If it isn’t you, I’d like you to tell me who you think it is. Nobody knew about this picture before. I’ve had it for weeks and
tried to talk to you about it. I may be an idiot, but I haven’t showed it to Henrik or anyone else because I’m deathly afraid
of casting suspicion on you or doing you wrong."

In early October Salander read an article on the Internet edition of the Hedestad Courier. She told Blomkvist about it.
Isabella Vanger had died after a short illness. She was mourned by her daughter, Harriet Vanger, lately returned from
Australia.
Encrypted email from
<erika.berger@millennium.se>
To <mikael.blomkvist@millennium.se>:
Hi Mikael.
Harriet Vanger came to see me at the office today. She called five minutes before she arrived, and I was totally unprepared."
The_Girl_With_The_Dragon_Tattoo_27_42,"He realised that he had failed to discuss her mania for that sect in Skellefteå with
her mother. He could not tell them that it was his daughter’s obviously profound knowledge of the Bible that had set
him on the right track regarding Harriet Vanger’s disappearance. He had not talked to his daughter since then.
He was not a good father.
He kissed his daughter goodbye after the lunch and met Salander at Slussen. They went out to Sandhamn. They
had not seen much of each other since the Millennium bomb exploded. They arrived late on Christmas Eve and stayed
for the holidays.

Blomkvist was entertaining company, as always, but Salander had an uneasy feeling that he was looking at her with an
especially odd expression when she paid back the loan with a cheque for 120,000 kronor.
They took a walk to Trovill and back (which Salander considered a waste of time), had Christmas dinner at the inn,
and went back to the cabin where they lit a fire in the woodstove, put on an Elvis CD, and devoted themselves to some
plain old sex. When Salander from time to time came up for air, she tried to analyse her feelings.
She had no problem with Blomkvist as a lover. There was obviously a physical attraction. And he never tried to tutor
her.
Her problem was that she could not interpret her own feelings for him. Not since before reaching puberty had she
lowered her guard to let another person get so close as she had with him."
The_Girl_With_The_Dragon_Tattoo_21_118,"Vanger’s house was empty but for Anna. Harald Vanger’s house looked
deserted as always. Then he saw Isabella Vanger in her back garden. She was sitting there, obviously talking to
someone. It took a second for Blomkvist to realise it was the sickly Gerda Vanger, born in 1922 and living with her son,
Alexander, in one of the houses beyond Henrik’s. He had never met her, but he had seen her a few times. Cecilia
Vanger’s house looked empty, but then Mikael saw a movement in her kitchen. She’s home. Was the marksman a
woman? He knew that Cecilia could handle a gun."
The_Lovely_Bones_22_14,"“Ruth, are you okay?” And then he reached
her and grabbed on.
“Ruth, Ruth,” he yelled. “What happened?”
And I was in Ruth’s eyes and I was looking up. I could feel the
arch of her back against the pavement, and scrapes inside her
clothes where flesh had been torn away by the gravel’s sharp
edges. I felt every sensation — the warmth of the sun, the smell of
the asphalt — but I could not see Ruth.
I heard Ruth’s lungs bubbling, a giddiness there in her stomach, but air still filling her lungs. Then tension stretching out the
body. Her body. Ray above, his eyes — gray, pulsing, looking up

and down the road hopelessly for help that was not coming. He
had not seen the car but had come through the scrub delighted,
carrying a bouquet of wildflowers for his mother, and there was
Ruth, lying in the road.
Ruth pushed up against her skin, wanting out. She was fighting
to leave and I was inside now, struggling with her. I willed her
back, willed that divine impossible, but she wanted out."
Know_My_Name_3_59,"You left me a voice mail, he
said. You sound obliterated. I said, Don’t delete it. Promise me you won’t
delete it?
Is everything okay? You sound sad, he said. I nodded, as if he could hear
this. Just sleepy, I said. I went inside, stripped my iPhone of its dirty case,
but didn’t wash it. I folded my sweat suit, tucked it into the back of my
drawers. I slid my orange folder onto my shelf, my hospital bracelet clipped
off and tucked inside it."
The_Girl_With_The_Dragon_Tattoo_21_93,"Then he heard the front door open again and seconds later
she was back in the doorway. This time she was not smiling.
“You’d better come and look at this,” she said in a strange voice.
Blomkvist was on his feet at once and pulled on his jeans.
During the night someone had been to the cottage with an unwelcome present. On the porch lay the half-charred
corpse of a cat. The cat’s legs and head had been cut off, then the body had been flayed and the guts and stomach
removed, flung next to the corpse, which seemed to have been roasted over a fire. The cat’s head was intact, on the
saddle of Salander’s motorcycle. He recognised the reddish-brown fur.

CHAPTER 22
Thursday, July 10
They ate breakfast in the garden in silence and without milk in their coffee. Salander had taken out a Canon digital
camera and photographed the macabre tableau before Blomkvist got a rubbish sack and cleaned it away. He put the
cat in the boot of the Volvo. He ought to file a police report for animal cruelty, possibly intimidation, but he did not think
he would want to explain why the intimidation had taken place.
At 8:30 Isabella Vanger walked past and on to the bridge. She did not see them or at least pretended not to.
“How are you doing?” Blomkvist said.
“Oh, I’m fine.” Salander looked at him, perplexed."
The_Girl_With_The_Dragon_Tattoo_21_61,"She had countless contusions and fractures.”
“Jesus Christ. Lisbeth, this is fucking disgusting.”
“It gets worse. The initials R.L. are correct—you found the Bible quote?”
“Overly explicit. A man or a woman who is a medium or a wizard shall be put to death; they shall be stoned with
stones, their blood shall be upon them.”
“Then there’s Sjöberg in Ranmo outside Karlstad. She’s the one Harriet listed as Magda. Her full name was Magda
Lovisa, but people called her Lovisa.”
Blomkvist listened while Salander recounted the bizarre details of the Karlstad murder. When she lit a cigarette he
pointed at the pack, and she pushed it over to him.
“So the killer attacked the animal too?”
“The Leviticus verse says that if a woman has sex with an animal, both must be killed.”
“The likelihood of this woman having sex with a cow must be . . ."
The_Girl_With_The_Dragon_Tattoo_16_57,"He never did quite
understand the technical reasons behind his release, but it may have had something to do with the fact that he did not
use any holiday leave and that the prison population was forty-two while the number of beds was thirty-one. In any
case, the warden—Peter Sarowsky, a forty-year-old Polish exile—with whom Blomkvist got along well, wrote a
recommendation that his sentence be reduced.
His time at Rullåker had been unstressful and pleasant enough. The prison had been designed, as Sarowsky
expressed it, for hooligans and drunk drivers, not for hardened criminals. The daily routines reminded him of living in a
youth hostel. His fellow prisoners, half of whom were second-generation immigrants, regarded Blomkvist as
something of a rare bird in the group. He was the only inmate to appear on the TV news, which lent him a certain
status.
On his first day, he was called in for a talk and offered therapy, training from Komvux, or the opportunity for other adult
education, and occupational counselling. He did not feel any need at all for social rehabilitation, he had completed his
studies, he thought, and he already had a job. On the other hand, he asked for permission to keep his iBook in his cell
so that he could continue to work on the book he was commissioned to write. His request was granted without further
ado, and Sarowsky arranged to bring him a lockable cabinet so that he could leave the computer in his cell. Not that
any of the inmates would have stolen or vandalised it or anything like that."

of a girl suspected him but no one else did. He had perfected his
patter to the police, a certain obsequious innocence peppered
with wonder about their procedures or useless ideas that he presented as if they might help. Bringing up the Ellis boy with
Fenerman had been a good stroke, and the lie that he was a widower always helped. He fashioned a wife out of whichever victim
he’d recently been taking pleasure in in his memory, and to flesh
her out there was always his mother.
He left the house every day for an hour or two in the afternoon.
He would pick up any supplies he needed and then drive out to
Valley Forge Park and walk the paved roads and the unpaved
trails and find himself suddenly surrounded by school tours at
George Washington’s log cabin or the Washington Memorial
Chapel. This would buoy him up — these moments when the
children were eager to see history, as if they might actually find a
long silver hair from Washington’s wig caught on the rough end
of a log post.
Occasionally one of the tour guides or teachers would notice
him standing there, unfamiliar even if amiable, and he would be
met with a questioning stare. He had a thousand lines to give
them: “I used to bring my children here.” “This is where I met my
wife.” He knew to ground whatever he said in connection to
some imagined family, and then the women would smile at him.
Once an attractive, heavy woman tried to engage him in conversation while the park guide told the children about the winter of
1776 and the Battle of the Clouds.
He had used the story of widowhood and talked about a
woman named Sophie Cichetti, making her his now-deceased
wife and true love. It had been like luscious food to this woman,
and, as he listened to her tell him about her cats and her brother,
who had three children, whom she loved, he pictured her sitting
on the chair in his basement, dead.
After that, when he met a teacher’s questioning glare he would

shyly back off and go somewhere else inside the park. He
watched mothers with their children still in strollers walk briskly
along the exposed paths. He saw teenagers who were cutting
school necking in the uncut fields or along the interior trails. And
at the highest point of the park was a small wood beside which he
sometimes parked."
The_Girl_With_The_Dragon_Tattoo_21_142,"He sat at the desk and opened the first album.
Vanger had saved every last family photograph. Many were obviously from long before his time. The oldest pictures
dated back to the 1870s, showing gruff men and stern women. There were pictures of Vanger’s parents. One showed
his father celebrating Midsummer with a large and cheerful group in Sandhamn in 1906. Another Sandhamn
photograph showed Fredrik Vanger and his wife, Ulrika, with Anders Zorn and Albert Engström sitting at a table. Other
photographs showed workers on the factory floor and in offices. He found Captain Oskar Granath who had transported
Vanger and his beloved Edith Lobach to safety in Karlskrona.
Anna came upstairs with a cup of coffee. He thanked her. By then he had reached modern times and was paging
through images of Vanger in his prime, opening factories, shaking hands with Tage Erlander, one of Vanger and
Marcus Wallenberg—the two capitalists staring grimly at each other.
In the same album he found a spread on which Vanger had written in pencil “Family Council 1966.” Two colour
photographs showed men talking and smoking cigars."
The_Girl_With_The_Dragon_Tattoo_21_27,"He even said that you thought you had
caused the attack.”
“I don’t think so any more. Henrik had severe blockages in his arteries. He could have had a heart attack just by
having a pee. I’m sure you know that by now.”
“I want full disclosure into this lunacy. This is my family you’re mucking around in.”
“I told you, I work for Henrik, not for the family.”
Birger Vanger was apparently not used to having anyone stand up to him. For a moment he stared at Blomkvist with
an expression that was presumably meant to instil respect, but which made him look more like an inflated moose.
Birger turned and went into Vanger’s room.
Blomkvist restrained the urge to laugh. This was no place for laughter, in the corridor outside Vanger’s sickbed,
which might also turn out to be his deathbed. But he thought of a verse from Lennart Hyland’s rhyming alphabet. It was

the letter M. And all alone the moose he stood, laughing in a shot-up wood.
In the hospital lobby he ran into Cecilia Vanger."
Know_My_Name_3_77,"He’ll
be back for arraignment, arraignment is Monday, what is arraignment?
Emails appeared in my in-box, contacts I’d need, follow-up information. I
labeled the new numbers in my phone, placing a red dot emoji next to each
name.
Tiffany was calling me. She said her full name along with Julia’s had
been leaked in some of the articles. Julia had been outed, talk was swelling
on campus and her mother, Anne, had already received emails from
concerned Stanford parents. Anne told us to stay calm, passed on legal
advice: People will approach you and say they are an “investigator for the
court”—which sounds very official, but they probably work for the defense
or press. These folks could show up at your dorm or house. Be prepared to
say “no comment.” Hang in there, girls.

“How did her father drown?”
“In the most prosaic way possible. He fell out of a rowing boat right below his cabin. He had his trousers open and

an extremely high alcohol content in his blood, so you can just imagine how it happened. Martin was the one who
found him.”
“I didn’t know that.”
“It’s funny. Martin has turned out to be a really fine person."

me, every woman in that room. It was as if she were tossing my shoes out
into the audience urging everyone to try them on.
You’re not a bad person or a good person, but what you did on that
night is not acceptable, it’s not okay, and it violates the law. Once you
stripped everything of complex terms and formalities, the truth was solid
and pure. It’s not okay, never okay, for someone to hurt you. There are no
asterisks, no exceptions, to this statement.
Don’t forget that there’s a victim in this case that he violated. And when
you do that, you’ll see that there’s only one reasonable verdict and that’s
one of guilt on all counts. . . . The burden that he has in this case is the
burden of guilt."

Konsum store was conveniently located about three hundred yards away. He filled two paper bags to overflowing with
supplies and then carried them home before returning across the bridge. This time he stopped at Susanne’s Bridge
Café. The woman behind the counter was in her fifties. He asked whether she was Susanne and then introduced
himself by saying that he was undoubtedly going to be a regular customer. He was for the time being the only
customer, and Susanne offered him coffee when he ordered sandwiches and bought a loaf of bread. He picked up a
copy of the Hedestad Courier from the newspaper rack and sat at a table with a view of the bridge and the church, its
facade now lit up. It looked like a Christmas card. It took him about four minutes to read the newspaper. The only news
of interest was a brief item explaining that a local politician by the name of Birger Vanger (Liberal) was going to invest
in “IT TechCent”—a technology development centre in Hedestad."
Know_My_Name_3_60,"I had a strange desire to preserve everything,
artifacts that proved the existence of this alternate reality.
The next day was Martin Luther King Day, the last day of the long
weekend. Before Tiffany drove back to school, I wanted to show her this
was not a time to disengage or distance ourselves, we had to stay close to
Mom and Dad. I proposed we go out for dinner. We stood waiting to be
seated, next to red paper decorations, a bowl of melon candies, a tank full of
frowning fish. We ordered an entire Peking duck. As always, my mom
prepped us with a demonstration; lay out the circular bun, spread a dollop
of plum sauce, add a crispy morsel of crimson duck meat, a few sprigs of
green onion and cucumber stalks, wrapping it all up. Mom is rolling duck
blunts. Mom, Mom look, Quack Kush. After dinner, my sister drove the two
hundred miles back to school, through stretches of flatland, Gilroy, Salinas,
King City, back to San Luis Obispo. She said she was scared to leave me
alone."
Forget_Me_Not_2_17,"I can’t explain the pressure, but somewhere in the
invisible movement of the universe something snaps its fingers and reminds me of the reality of the situation.
I think I know the man in front of me, but I don’t.
I think I might be dreaming, but I’m not.
I think I must be in love with Silas—but my partner is passed out on our bed just beyond the door behind him.
I clear my throat and find a line in the floor tiles to trace with the tip of my sock. “So, was it really that bad?”
Silas looks down too, letting his teeth worry his bottom lip.
He thinks for a second to tell me just how bad it really was. That he’d mistaken Logan for a common idiot, when he’s truly just an ungrateful mythomaniac. Silas
could get past him lying about the book, it worked to his advantage anyway. A little white lie that did no more harm than good. But then the pattern resumed when
Logan lied about the reason he wanted to meet him at the bar, not to mention the borderline inebriation before Silas even got there.
He could tell me about the way Logan talked about me, my body, my bedroom habits. To a man he met the day before, nonetheless.
It made his skin crawl thinking about what Logan might have said if he were talking to a friend.
But no, that’s not the type of man Silas is.
He wouldn’t capitalize on another man’s misfortune, if he could even call it that. To use Logan’s faults against him would be a dirty game, one he didn’t want to
play.
When Silas does finally have me, in his arms, his bed, he wants it to be on my own accord—because I chose him, not because I resent Logan.
“No.” Silas eventually shakes his head. “No, we’ve all been there time and again, Birdie.” He keeps his eyes on the ground as he speaks and I wonder if it’s
because he’s lying. “Liquor is fickle in its loyalties.”
I’m almost positive he’s keeping something from me, but I decide it’s probably better left unsaid."
Know_My_Name_5_4,"When we arrived home

in Palo Alto after graduation, the tower tumbled, blocks spilling
everywhere.
I’d heard about heartbreak in songs, sure, but holy shit, damn. There
should be a name for that feeling. It really winds you. How to exist without
this person? In his shelter, I was brave, loved. I emerged single, twenty-two,
naive, and starving. The space that remained was cavernous and I vowed to
fill it.
I remember people always telling me there are other fish in the sea, and
I said, Yes, that’s where they fucking live. But he had been a rare species of
lionfish, and I’d lost him. What do you do when you lose someone, or when
they choose to lose you? I went through anchovies, stodgy bass, pompous
angelfish, to replace him."
The_Girl_With_The_Dragon_Tattoo_21_53,"I work for Henrik. Henrik and I have been friends for forty-five years, and we are in
complete agreement in such matters. If Henrik should die it is in point of fact I—not Martin—who would inherit Henrik’s
share in the subsidiary. We have a contract in which we have undertaken to back Millennium for three years. Should
Martin wish to start any mischief—which I don’t believe he will—then theoretically he could put the brakes on a small
number of new advertisers.”
“The lifeblood of Millennium’s existence.”
“Yes, but look at it this way—worrying about such trivia is a waste of time. Martin is presently fighting for his industrial
survival and working fourteen hours a day. He doesn’t have time for anything else.”
“May I ask—I know it’s none of my business—what is the general condition of the corporation?”
Frode looked grave.
“We have problems.”
“Yes, even a common financial reporter like myself can see that. I mean, how serious is it?”
“Off the record?”
“Between us.”
“We’ve lost two large orders in the electronics industry in the past few weeks and are about to be ejected from the
Russian market. In September we’re going to have to lay off 1,600 employees in Örebro and Trollhättan. Not much of a
reward to give to people who’ve worked for the company for many years."
The_Girl_With_The_Dragon_Tattoo_26_13,"A beautiful woman,
elegant clothes and a cool gaze.
She came to tell me that she’ll be replacing Martin Vanger as Henrik’s representative on our board. She was polite and friendly and assured me that
the Vanger Corporation had no plans to back out of the agreement. On the contrary, the family stands fully behind Henrik’s obligations to the
magazine. She asked for a tour of the editorial offices, and she wanted to know how I see the situation.
I told her the truth. That it feels as if I don’t have solid ground under my feet, that you have forbidden me to come to Sandhamn, and that I don’t
know what you’re working on, other than that you are planning to sink Wennerström. (I assumed it was OK to say that. She is on the board, after
all.) She raised an eyebrow and smiled and asked if I had doubts that you’d succeed. What was I supposed to say to that? I said that I would sleep
a little easier if I knew exactly what you were writing. Jeez, of course I trust you."
Forget_Me_Not_5_60,"I knock again, louder.
“Hey, are you in there?”
I give it about ten seconds of radio silence from the other side before I try the slide and it jars open.
He’s not here.
When I drop inside the space it looks disheveled, like a wind spin swept through and knocked every loose item in the vessel off its balance. The bed is unmade,
sheets on the floor, drawers half pulled open, books and paper scattered about. All of my things are still intact, though. I muse the room, bending down to pull a
duffel out of a storage hull and then start filling it.
Logan’s not here but he’ll be back. I got lucky just now, sliding into the fray while he was gone, and I know I can’t lollygag and take my time dissecting the mess
he left. I have to get my shit and go.
I shove all of what I can of my casual wear into the bag, balling items up in haste and ramming the wrinkled linens into the corners. I smack several toiletries off
the counter into it next: shampoo, toothbrush, hairbrush, lotions, makeup bag to cover these Maker forsaken hickeys. Then jog to my night table to grab a comm
tablet, my earbuds, the camera.
I catch my reflection in the floor-length mirror as I bustle around and stop to look. My hair is a fucking mess. I’m basically wearing a set of mismatched
pajamas."
The_Girl_With_The_Dragon_Tattoo_21_139,"Greger Vanger was holding a Hasselblad in his hand on the day the bridge accident occurred. That means that
he also might have taken some pictures. Where would the pictures have ended up after his death?”
“With his widow or his son, logically. Let me call Alexander and ask him.”
“What am I looking for?” Salander said when they were on their way back to the island.
“Press clippings and staff newsletters. I want you to read through everything around the dates when the murders in
the fifties and sixties were committed. Make a note of anything that strikes you. Better if you do this part of the job. It
seems that your memory . . .”
She punched him in the side.
Five minutes later her Kawasaki was clattering across the bridge.
Blomkvist shook hands with Alexander Vanger."
The_Girl_With_The_Dragon_Tattoo_5_1,"He has about 250,000 SEK in the
bank, in both a retirement fund and a savings account. He has an account of around 100,000 kronor that he uses as
cash for working expenses, travel and such. He owns a co-op apartment that’s paid off—700 square feet on
Bellmansgatan—and he has no loans or debts. He has one other asset—some property in Sandhamn out in the
archipelago. It’s a cottage of 270 square feet, furnished as a summer cabin and by the water, right in the most
attractive part of the village. Apparently an uncle of his bought it in the forties, when such things were still possible for
normal mortals, and the cabin ended up in Blomkvist’s hands. They divided things up so that his sister got the parents’
apartment in Lilla Essingen and Blomkvist got the cabin. I have no idea what it might be worth today—certainly a few
million—but on the other hand he doesn’t seem to want to sell, and he goes out to Sandhamn fairly often.”
“Income?”
“He’s part owner of Millennium, but he only takes out about 12,000 in salary each month. The rest he earns from his
freelance jobs—the total varies. He had a big year three years ago when he took in around 450,000."
Forget_Me_Not_2_11,"The things Logan has that he hasn’t.
My boyfriend’s hair is long but well-trimmed, styled into an impressive mop that nearly touches his shoulders. Short, golden stubble with hints of red weaving
through the fuzz on his jaw. Silas knows when a man is attractive, he’s given into that inclination many times, and he can’t help now but notice his and Logan’s very
opposite features. The only time Silas has ever felt groomed was during his seldom stops between digs. When he could find a straight razor and clean the hair from
his cheeks and neck, take a blunt scissor to the furling hair over his ears. After seven cycles on the Pulp, he’s become brazenly unkempt in contrast.
Around the two men soft music plays, and the late dinner crowd of travelers have either found their way back to their pods, or sunken deeper into the black
leather booths under dim light. The room means to give off a night-clubby feel, no doubt coaxing the lonely, bored patrons on the freighter into a more welcoming
setting to mingle.
Silas gives the bartender a nod toward Logan’s empty bottles as she approaches, to let her know he’ll take one.
“She’s nice.” Logan points at the slender woman working behind the counter when she walks away. “She’d probably fuck you.”
Silas shakes his head and looks around, hoping that there’s no one within earshot of the pair of them that might mistake them for friends. “I’d hardly say a
woman being nice to you means she would sleep with you, Logan.”
“Nah man, you know what I mean,” his words are slurring as he takes a sip of his beer and points the neck of the bottle at Silas. “Like, if you’re looking for
someone to sleep with again—you know, she looks nice."
The_Girl_With_The_Dragon_Tattoo_5_11,"Blomkvist tried to
remember what their reasoning had been when he and Berger decided to hire him. He was competent, of course, and
had worked at the TT news bureau, the evening papers, and Eko on the radio. But he apparently did not like sailing
against the wind. During the past year Blomkvist had often regretted that they had hired Dahlman, who had an
enervating habit of looking at everything in as negative a light as possible.
“Have you heard from Christer?” Blomkvist asked without taking his eyes off the street.
Christer Malm was the art director and designer of Millennium. He was also part owner of the magazine together
with Berger and Blomkvist, but he was on a trip abroad with his boyfriend.
“He called to say hello.”
“He’ll have to be the one who takes over as publisher.”
“Lay off, Micke. As publisher you have to count on being punched in the nose every so often. It’s part of the job
description.”
“You’re right about that. But I was the one who wrote the article that was published in a magazine of which I also
happen to be the publisher. That makes everything look different all of a sudden. Then it’s a matter of bad judgement.”
Berger felt that the disquiet she had been carrying with her all day was about to explode."
The_Girl_With_The_Dragon_Tattoo_9_25,"I have an office in the guest house, and that’s where I’ll do my work.”
“As you wish.”
“If I need to talk to you, we’ll do it in your office, but I’m not going to start throwing questions at you tonight.”
“I understand.” The old man seemed improbably timid.
“It’s going to take a couple of weeks to read through the papers. We’ll work on two fronts. We’ll meet for a few hours
each day so that I can interview you and gather material for your biography. When I start having questions about Harriet
which I need to discuss with you, I’ll let you know.”
“That sounds sensible.”
“I’m going to require a free hand to do my work, and I won’t have any set work hours.”
“You decide for yourself how the work should be done.”
“I suppose you’re aware that I have to spend a couple of months in prison. I don’t know exactly when, but I’m not
going to appeal. It’ll probably be sometime this year.”
Vanger frowned. “That’s unfortunate. We’ll have to solve that problem when it comes up. You can always request a
postponement.”
“If it’s permitted and I have enough material, I might be able to work on your book in prison. One more thing: I’m still
part owner of Millennium and as of now it’s a magazine in crisis."
Midnight_Kisses_11_27,"“Do you have a
memory lag? Are you prone to forgetting things?”
“I could ask you the same thing. I know you had a good
time last Saturday. You told me so yourself, and if you try to
deny it, I’ll go door to door and ask for testimonials from
your neighbors.”
“Don’t be obnoxious.” I clutch my beauty sponge tighter.
“You know that’s not what I’m talking about.”
Otis appears at the bathroom door and leans against the
frame. I’m put off by what he said, but mostly, I’m livid at
how hyperaware he makes me. When I turn to face the
mirror to shun him, my curious eyes betray me, flickering
to his reflection, noticing new things about his physique
each time.
“Actually, I don’t,” he drawls, unrushed, suggestive.
I can’t stay still. Can’t keep staring at him. I make
myself busy by going into my closet and picking an outfit.
“What part of me kicking you out of my apartment did you
not get?”
“So you admit it. You lied. You didn’t have friends
coming over?” He sounds entitled and defensive.
“And?” I grunt, embarrassed at my inadvertent slip."
